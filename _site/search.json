We will use reading and reflection to help us contextualize our understanding of neighborhoods, however, our focus will be on learning by doing. Our class will meet in person twice per week - Tuesdays will typically be devoted to introducing and discussing new information, and Thursdays will typically be devoted to labs and independent work.\nUnless otherwise noted, please plan on bringing to class a computer that will run R and RStudio (available for PC/Mac/Linux) and for which you have administrative privileges.\n\nWhat to Expect from Me\n\nOffice Hours and Availability: Please make an appointment to speak one-on-one using my Calendly page. Of course, I’m also happy to chat either before or after our class if i’m available.\nEmail: The easiest way to communicate with me outside of class is via email. I try to respond to emails sent during the week within 24 hours. Emails sent over the weekend will receive a response within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from me after that amount of time, it’s okay to nudge me to respond.\nTroubleshooting: Plan on using our class Slack channel, email, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. The Resources page provides thoughts and resources for troubleshooting. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.\n\n\n\nWhat I Expect From You\n\nBe Present: I expect that you’ll engage fully in our course sessions and in our class community.\nActively Support Each Other: I expect that each of you will take on individual leadership roles within our class, that includes actively supporting our learning community over the course of the semester. This class assumes collaboration and sharing as part of our learning model.\nRead with Care: This course focuses on learning by doing, however, there are important details contained within the documentation on our course website and within reading selections. Details matter in this class - be intentional about reading carefully and completely important course documents (including this syllabus).\nAct with Integrity: I expect that you will act with integrity in all that you do in this class. The class contract grading system places trust in you to not just meet the nominal standards contained within the contract, but to push yourself to produce your best work.\nSeek Balance: I expect that you’ll actively work to find balance between the many demands in your life. This means budgeting adequate time to engage fully in our course but also budgeting time for adequate rest and sleep, exercise, and other actions that support your mental and physical health.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nUP 570: Neighborhood Analysis is open to students with graduate-level standing. The course assumes that you have previously taken UP 517: Data Science for Planners or have substantial experience with manipulating data in R.\nPlease talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you."

The place you select will be the location that you focus your social, economic, and demographic analysis on. Given the structure of this class, you need to choose a location in the United States.\nYour work will include thinking about how that place fits within its larger “region.” What do we mean by “place”? It might be a city or town—the City of Champaign—or even twin cities—the cities of Champaign and Urbana. It could also be a county. For our purposes, it is not an entire metropolitan area or a larger macro region (such as the Great Plains or Mississippi Delta)."

    "section": "Place Selection Considerations",
    "text": "Place Selection Considerations\n\nBig places—the cities of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York—are interesting. They are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse and it is usually not hard to find “stories in the data” with respect to neighborhood trends. However, large cities are very complex. Properly understanding the past, present, and future of such places and their neighborhoods can be a herculean task. Unless you are very familiar with a big place, we suggest focusing on a smaller place.\nMany of the techniques you will learn use methods that draw on data available at the census tract level, as census tracts are frequently used as (imperfect) proxies for neighborhoods. As you work to select your place, it may be useful to identify the number of census tracts that overlap. As a rule of thumb, your place should have no fewer than 15 tracts. More is certainly ok, but let’s talk if you are considering a place with fewer than 15 tracts.\nConsider selecting a place in a broader area of particular policy concern, such as an economically distressed region (central Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, or the Black Belt). Many communities in the Great Plains and Mountain states are not distressed by conventional measures but they face significant out-migration and population decline, which introduce their own challenges at the local level. Places around international borders can also be interesting to examine.\nConsider selecting a place within driving distance of Champaign-Urbana (although you may not select Champaign County or it’s constituent cities as your place). Making a site visit to the county and its principal urban centers could help you understand its conditions and context better, giving you the ability to write about it with more authority.\nHaving some personal experience in the place you select can be helpful. Many students select their hometown or other community/county in which they have lived, provided the criteria above are satisfied. Some students also select places there are interested in living or working in.\nIslands and territories (such as Puerto Rico and Hawaii) and remote areas (such as Alaska) are interesting, but geography and data availability can make them challenging places to analyze. Students have analyzed all of these places in recent years- but with extra effort needed to address data gaps and limitations. You may want to explore these issues before committing to one of these places.\nIf you have any questions about the places you are considering, or you wish to talk through your choices, please talk with me."

This payoff will come slowly over time - do not expect it to come easily.\n\nYou are not alone in this struggle. In addition to your classmates and others who are going through the same thing, there is a large R user community, and lots of existing documentation and troubleshooting. Any problem you will encounter has likely been encountered and addressed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen I run into an error, after an initial check for simple issues like closing parentheses and spelling errors, I copy and paste error codes directly into a web search to see how others have dealt with similar problems. I encourage you to do the same.\n\n\nYou got this, and there will be a payoff, so long as you use the tools consistently - I promise!\n\n\nWe’re Here For You\nWe’ve been living in particularly abnormal times for the last few years - while for many, things are improving, it would be irresponsible to expect that teaching and learning would occur “normally” right now. We continue to teach and learn under emergency circumstances.\nAs you face challenges this semester (and beyond) I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can."

    "text": "R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines. This means that in addition to being free and available for a range of operating systems and environments, R is also directly supported by a diverse user community who continually develop approaches for specialized applications or data. Need to download U.S. Census Data? There’s an R package for that. Need to perform common data cleaning tasks? There’s an R package for that too. We’ll be exploring a range of these specialized applications over the course of the semester.\nOf course there are alternate languages which we could employ in service of neighborhood analysis. Python, for example, is an even more ubiquitous programming language with its own set of tools for data science. R was originally built as a statistical computing language, and that brings some important benefits for the types of data science we’ll be learning this semester. R is also fairly prevalent among the user community working in public policy analysis and urban data science - this is the user community which you will be joining. Finally, R has a high learning curve, but also a very active user community, meaning that abundant documentation of problems and their solutions is available.\nAs we get started, let’s be clear - you are going to experience some frustration and challenges as you learn the R programming language. This class assumes no prior background in R or any other programming language for that matter, and we’ll work to quickly build your “vocabulary” and the ability to get results. We will spend some time picking up basics, and will then use our exploration of specific analysis approaches to reinforce our use of the grammar and structure of the language and to build more complex scripts over time.\nIt’s fair to equate learning R with learning to drive a manual car. Increasingly, people learn how to drive in automatic cars - essentially allowing the car to handle the function of switching gears - you put the car into drive, press the accelerator pedal and the car moves forward. Your past exposure to computer-based analytic tools has probably followed a similar strategy - you likely learned using software that had graphical user interfaces that allow them to call up and run programs and then spit out results. Most of us learn to point and click in order to accomplish a particular set of analytic tasks, meaning that if we want to generate the same results in the future, we would have to repeat all of those same steps over again.\nSo why learn on a manual? For many car enthusiasts, manuals are both more efficient and more engaging to drive - they offer additional control, and come with a heightened awareness of what the car is doing. Of course, they also come with a steep learning curve.\nSome of the same attributes apply to our use of R as a tool for analysis:\n\nFirst, a manual approach forces you to explicitly understand more of the requirements and assumptions that go into the analysis that you’re doing.\nSecond, you have to know your data (and its strengths and limitations) well in order to get it set up for analysis and to produce useful output.\nThird, this approach emphasizes reproducible analysis, meaning that you will develop workflows that can be repeated over and over again producing the same results - important for sharing your work with others and for accountability, especially within contexts related to public deliberation of the strengths and weaknesses of policy arguments.\n\nKeeping these three benefits in mind, we’ll be using the R software coupled with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to counter some of the downsides of a purely manual approach. RStudio will help us implement R code more effectively and efficiently. Hopefully at this point, this prospect leaves you excited rather than daunted!"

You may also choose from an alternate installer if you believe it is more appropriate for your operating system.\nDownload and install RStudio, again using the default installation settings.\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open RStudio. You should see something that looks like this (the information in your console window will likely describe a newer version of R than what is displayed here).\n\nYou’ll note that what appears in the portion of the console to the left looks very similar to the R console window which you opened before you started your install of RStudio. This console functions in exactly the same way, however, you’ll also note that there are other areas which you have access to as well.\n## Rtools error (PC users)\nSome PC users may encounter an error message regarding Rtools not being installed. This would come up with you first try to install a package such as tidyverse either using R’s package manager or using the install.packages() command. To remedy this error if it occurs, PC users need to close R, manually download a patch, install it, and restart your computer. This error should then be remedied.\nIf you are a PC user who encounters this error, please do the following: 1. Save any work and close your RStudio session 2. Download Rtools (download link) + the link above contains instructions for putting Rtools on the PATH - you should not need to do this. 3. Run the downloaded executable file to install Rtools 4. Restart your computer 5. Re-open RStudio - the problem should be resolved"

    "text": "The Lab\n\n\nFile System and Structure\nWhen you started learning R and RStudio, you likely struggled a bit with some of the core concepts related to how R views your computer’s file system and where it looks for files and stores work. There’s nothing to complex about what R is doing, but as computers have become better at making sensible decisions for us, it can be easy to lose track of some of the basics of how we need to set up file structures that help us to actively manage our workflows and outputs.\nThere are a few basics which we need to have down. The first is a gentle reminder about how computer file systems work. Back when I was a kid in the early 1980s, the primary way we interacted with computers was at the command line. When you started a computer, you might be greeted with something that looks like the terminal tab in your RStudio session:\n From here, you’d type commands to either navigate between directories, list files in a directory, or execute files. For instance, we can use ls to list all the files in my home directory: \nAnd then take a look at the results: \nWhich is the equivalent of looking at what files are in my computer’s home directory in a graphical user interface: \nWhile for the most part we wont be bothered with accessing our file system this way, it’s useful to understand what’s going on with the pathnames that are shown. Whether you’re used to working with Mac, PC, or Linux operating systems, the approach to file systems is sufficiently similar to talk about them all together.\nMost modern operating systems operate using relative pathnames which allow us to be more efficient in referencing where files are located in our computer. The path that you saw above on my computer points to the “home directory” which is the base directory associated with my user account on the computer. My home director is situated however within other directories that are part of the operating system and that are ultimately on a hard disk drive.\n So why is all of this important? This underscores the rationale for and utility of relative paths in our filesystem. My mac computer’s home directory is Machinsosh HD/Users/andrewgreenlee/ which means that rather than having to type out all of that content, I can just start instructions to paths beloww that directory. For instance, let’s navigate to my desktop folder: \nWhich is the same as navigating from the root folder of our hard drive to the desktop folder: \nThis certainly makes things more convenient for navigating files in Terminal and in our file system. It has a much deeper utulity when we are thinking about reproducible data analysis. Let’s explore in more detail.\n\nDirectory Structure and R\nOFtentimes when people begin learning in R and RStudio, they simply open the program and start typing commands. This works well up until the point when one needs to get data into or out of R. In general, R is agnostic about where to look for files - if you open RStudio without specifying where to look for files, it assumes you want to work out of your home directory (the getwd() command returns the current working directory R is using): \nWe typically do not want to work out of our home directory, but would like to set another directory to work out of. When new R users start to work in R, many are taught to use setwd() to explicitly set a directory to work out of. This will work, and sets a “home” directory for the particular work you are doing.\n\nsetwd(\"Desktop/andrew-home/neighborhood_types/\")\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let’s say we wnat to open a dataset containing a list of community area definitions for Chicago:\n\ndataset <- read.csv(\"CommAreas.csv\")\ndataset\n\nWe create a script in our working directory that sets the directory, reads the file, and then shows the file to us.\nWhat happens when you move your working folder to another computer or share it? If you explicitly set your working directory, it won’t be able to access that directory which is at a path that doesn’t exist on your other computer:\n R Projects help us to address this problem. Projects add a file to the folder we wish to set as our home directory for our project which establishes where R will look for files.\nIn the right top corner of your RStudio window, you’ll note a blue cube which leads to a project management menu:\n If you click “New Project”, a dialog box will open up which allows you to specify project options:\n\nYou have options here - you can either create a new project in a new folder, use an existing folder which you’ve already created, or check a project out from Github or another vesion control system. Since we already have a directory we’ve been working out of, we can use the existing directory dialog, and then set the directory where our script and data are located.\n\nFrom here, so long as we open our work by clicking on the project file, we’ll be taken into the project which will remember what the “home” directory is for our work. \nThe benefit of this approach is that if we move our project directory to another computer and open our project, R understands that the folder with the project file reflects the relative path to where we will find the other files referenced in our project. This means that if we share our working folder with others, they can reproduce what we did so long as all files are contained within that project directory.\nProject files represent mileposts that set the relative path at which RStudio will look for files within our particular project. This is useful for creating a project file structure within which we can create reproducible and easily shareable analysis. You should be in the habit of starting each new analysis you do by setting up a new work folder with a new project file.\n\n\n\nProjects vs. Workspaces\nEach time you close your RStudio session, you will be faced with a temptation - RStudio will ask whether you want to save your workspace.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a script, a project, and a workspace? A script contains the code which tells R what you want it to do. Script commands are run in the console in the order they are written. You want to get in the habit of saving your script files often. Your project file tells R the path to look for files and folders at. This sets a relative path for your work in that project. A workspace file saves the exact image of what’s going on when you close out of RStudio - that may include loaded datasets, functions, and objects.\nYou have likely been tempted to save your workspace when you are closing your R session. While tempting, I encourage you not to get in the habit of saving your workspace. This runs counter to most other interactions you’ve had with computers - saving documents, video games, or survey responses. Saving your workspace can lead to bad habits with regards to reproducibility. You want to allow your scripts to serve as a repository for all steps that go from your raw data to your analysis and outputs. Unless your script has time or computationally intensive steps, your scripts and computer can re-run your workflow to return to the point that you left off when you last worked on the project.\n\n\nLater in the class, we’ll introduce more powerful strategies like the renv and Targets packages which can help to manage your workflows and their dependencies.\nMore Here"

This runs counter to most other interactions you’ve had with computers - saving documents, video games, or survey responses. Saving your workspace can lead to bad habits with regards to reproducibility. You want to allow your scripts to serve as a repository for all steps that go from your raw data to your analysis and outputs. Unless your script has time or computationally intensive steps, your scripts and computer can re-run your workflow to return to the point that you left off when you last worked on the project.\n\n\nLater in the class, we’ll introduce more powerful strategies like the renv and Targets packages which can help to manage your workflows and their dependencies."

    "text": "Working in Quarto\nQuarto is a tool built into RStudio which allows you to create a variety of documents that can integrate plain text and code. It’s utility comes both in it’s ability to translate plain text into a variety of well-formatted outputs, but also due to the ease with which we can use this format to share code, analysis, and writing with others. Most of your written assignments in class will be produced in Quarto, therefore, you’ll want to become familiar with the basic syntax and logic.\nQuarto’s plain text formatting is handled using Markdown syntax which is designed to be simple, easily interpreted as text with formatting in place, and readable on most computers. An increasing number of note systems and word processors have adopted Markdown as their language.\n\n\nSome examples include Bear, Obsidian, Notion, Ulysses. Mentions are not endorsements.\n\nFormatting Your Documents\nQuarto makes use of a modified version of Markdown syntax. The Quarto website maintains excellent documentation regarding basic markdown formatting options as well as Quarto-specific formatting options:\n\nYou should familiarize yourself with how to format text, how to use section headings, and how to link files and insert references to other files.\n\n\nAdding References\nQuarto can help you either manage references in very sinple ways or more complex ways. You can either add references directly to your text as either footnotes or endnotes.\n\nFootnotes\nWe oftentimes use footnotes as an easy way to convey references or links to details or important information that does not need to be in our main body of text. Quarto allows you to create both footnotes and long notes. Footnotes are typically short and take up only a line or two. Long notes are longer and may contain multiple paragraphs.\n  \nHere is some text with a footnote.[^1]\n\n[^1]: And here is the footnote that accompanies that text in the footnotes section.\n\nHere is also some text with an inline footnote.^[Here is the text associated with the inline footnote - this may be easier to track because it is in line with the text.]\n\nHere is some text with a longnote.[^longnote]\n\n[^longnote]: And here is a longnote that takes up multiple lines. You can experiment in your text to see whether a footnote or longnote will serve you better for a given situation.\n  \n  This text is also part of the long note - the indent signals that it remains part of the note.\n  \nAnd this text would be part of the next paragraph that's outside of the note because it is not indented.\nHere is some text with a footnote1\nHere is also some text with an inline footnote.2\nHere is some text with a longnote3\nAnd this text would be part of the next paragraph that’s outside of the note because it is not indented.\n\n\nAsides\nYou can also add asides to documents which places a note in line with text in the margin.\n\n\nFor a very effective example of asides, see Kieran Healy’s book Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.\n:::{.aside}\nHere is an aside placed in line with text in the margin.\n:::\n\n\nHere is an aside placed in line with text in the margin.\n\n\nCitations and Bibliographies\nFor longer or more advanced documents, you may wish to rely upon Quarto’s suppot for using and managing references with BibTex, a standard reference format. This allows you to add references to your document and then create in line citations and a formatted bibliography to accompany your writing.\nIn order to create a bibliography that is associated with a document, you’ll need three files:\n\nA main file written in Quarto Markdown (.qmd). This file will be formatted to include citation references.\nA bibliographic data source, typically a Bibtex (.bibtex) file.\nA csl file - this specifies the format for your bibliography. You can find and include different csl files to produce a bibliography using different reference styles.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a bibliography file.\nUsing a text editor, create a plain text file that will contain your bibliographic references. In this case, we’ll create a text file called “references.bib”. Note that this file should end in .bib to signify that it is a bibliographic reference file.\n\n\nStep 2: Refer to the bibliography file in your YAML Header\nNext, in your Quarto Markdown document, you’ll add a line to your YAML header that refers to the location and name of your bibliography file.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define a citation style\nLike most other reference management systems, you can define what reference syle your references will be rendered as, and change this as needed. The Citation Style Language (CSL) project defines a common language and structure for styles. These are stored in .csl files which you will associate with your document. You can find and download .csl files in a range of formats from the CSL Project’s repository.\n\n\nYou can also find and download csl files in Zotero’s style repository. If you hover over a style format, it provides examples of what a citation will look like in your redered document.\nFor the sake of example, we’ll format our document using American Psychological Association (APA) format. We’ll search the CSL Project’s repository to find an appropriate APA style .csl file. Once you find the appropriate file, then download the file and place it in the same directory as our .bib file.\n Click on the .csl style format you want to use. You’ll then be taken to a page that includes the specific file’s contents.\n\nFrom here, you can right click on the button that says “raw” and download the .csl file.\n Note that before you move this file from your download folder to the folder where your .bib file is located, you may need to alter the file extension to indicate that this is a .csl file. Once you have done this, move it to the folder where your .bib file is located and then add a csl reference to your YAML header.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa-6th-edition.csl\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Add references to your document\nYou’re now set up to add references to your document. You can add references in lots of different ways. If you’re searching for references using a service like Google Scholar, under the “cite” options for a given reference, you’ll see a URL to download the BibTeX citation associated with that reference.\n Click on BibTeX and the citation contents will show:\n\nCopy this text, and paste it into your bibliographic reference file (in our example, references.bib).\n\nYou can then cite this reference while you write by referring to it as follows:\n\n\nCode\n[@healy2018data] provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\n\n\n(Healy, 2018) provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\nNote that the actual reference corresponds to the first clause in the bibtex reference.\n\n\nYou can change the reference name if you’d like to something you’ll remember as you cite.\nYou can paste more references into the same references.bib file and cite them as well.\n\n\nYou can find more details on formatting citations on the Quarto website.\nOnline tools like Citation Machine can help you to build references for a range of online sources. (Feder, n.d.) takes a little while to get used to, but these tools can help you to build out an effective citation workflow.\n\n\nStep 5: Place your bibliography\nQuarto will automatically place your references at the end of your document (or wherever your style definition file calls for references to be placed). You can also explicitly tell Quarto where to place your references by creating a div as follows:\n\n\nCode\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\nYou should end up with a formatted reference section at the end of your document.\n ### Reference Considerations\nIt’s ultimately up to you how you manage and generate references within your documents. If you have a document with very few references, footnotes and/or endnotes may be an appropriate strategy. A more complex document with many references may be better managed using BibTeX. You can also use another reference management system and then export citations in BibTeX format which can then be added to your Quarto Markdown document."

    "text": "Workflow 1: Set up a New Project\nThe first workflow we need to develop is proper project setup in R. In our next lab, we’ll add some more complexity to this project setup by incorporating version control and sharing, but we’ll start by getting a handle on projects that reside on our local computer. Let’s start with a quick review of file system and structure, and then transition into the nuts and bolds of project setup.\n\nFile System and Structure\n\nWhen you started learning R and RStudio, you likely struggled a bit with some of the core concepts related to how R views your computer’s file system and where it looks for files and stores work. There’s nothing to complex about what R is doing, but as computers have become better at making sensible decisions for us, it can be easy to lose track of some of the basics of how we need to set up file structures that help us to actively manage our workflows and outputs.\nThere are a few basics which we need to have down. The first is a gentle reminder about how computer file systems work. Back when I was a kid in the early 1980s, the primary way we interacted with computers was at the command line. When you started a computer, you might be greeted with something that looks like the terminal tab in your RStudio session:\n From here, you’d type commands to either navigate between directories, list files in a directory, or execute files. For instance, we can use ls to list all the files in my home directory: \nAnd then take a look at the results: \nWhich is the equivalent of looking at what files are in my computer’s home directory in a graphical user interface: \nWhile for the most part we wont be bothered with accessing our file system this way, it’s useful to understand what’s going on with the pathnames that are shown. Whether you’re used to working with Mac, PC, or Linux operating systems, the approach to file systems is sufficiently similar to talk about them all together.\nMost modern operating systems operate using relative pathnames which allow us to be more efficient in referencing where files are located in our computer. The path that you saw above on my computer points to the “home directory” which is the base directory associated with my user account on the computer. My home director is situated however within other directories that are part of the operating system and that are ultimately on a hard disk drive.\n So why is all of this important? This underscores the rationale for and utility of relative paths in our filesystem. My mac computer’s home directory is Machinsosh HD/Users/andrewgreenlee/ which means that rather than having to type out all of that content, I can just start instructions to paths beloww that directory. For instance, let’s navigate to my desktop folder: \nWhich is the same as navigating from the root folder of our hard drive to the desktop folder: \nThis certainly makes things more convenient for navigating files in Terminal and in our file system. It has a much deeper utulity when we are thinking about reproducible data analysis. Let’s explore in more detail.\n\nDirectory Structure and R\nOftentimes when people begin learning in R and RStudio, they simply open the program and start typing commands. This works well up until the point when one needs to get data into or out of R. In general, R is agnostic about where to look for files - if you open RStudio without specifying where to look for files, it assumes you want to work out of your home directory (the getwd() command returns the current working directory R is using): \nWe typically do not want to work out of our home directory, but would like to set another directory to work out of. When new R users start to work in R, many are taught to use setwd() to explicitly set a directory to work out of. This will work, and sets a “home” directory for the particular work you are doing.\n\n\nCode\nsetwd(\"Desktop/andrew-home/neighborhood_types/\")\n\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let’s say we wnat to open a dataset containing a list of community area definitions for Chicago:\n\n\nCode\ndataset <- read.csv(\"CommAreas.csv\")\ndataset\n\n\nWe create a script in our working directory that sets the directory, reads the file, and then shows the file to us.\nWhat happens when you move your working folder to another computer or share it? If you explicitly set your working directory, it won’t be able to access that directory which is at a path that doesn’t exist on your other computer:\n R Projects help us to address this problem. Projects add a file to the folder we wish to set as our home directory for our project which establishes where R will look for files.\nIn the right top corner of your RStudio window, you’ll note a blue cube which leads to a project management menu:\n If you click “New Project”, a dialog box will open up which allows you to specify project options:\n\nYou have options here - you can either create a new project in a new folder, use an existing folder which you’ve already created, or check a project out from Github or another vesion control system. Since we already have a directory we’ve been working out of, we can use the existing directory dialog, and then set the directory where our script and data are located.\n\nFrom here, so long as we open our work by clicking on the project file, we’ll be taken into the project which will remember what the “home” directory is for our work. \nThe benefit of this approach is that if we move our project directory to another computer and open our project, R understands that the folder with the project file reflects the relative path to where we will find the other files referenced in our project. This means that if we share our working folder with others, they can reproduce what we did so long as all files are contained within that project directory.\nProject files represent mileposts that set the relative path at which RStudio will look for files within our particular project. This is useful for creating a project file structure within which we can create reproducible and easily shareable analysis. You should be in the habit of starting each new analysis you do by setting up a new work folder with a new project file.\n\n\nProjects vs. Workspaces\nEach time you close your RStudio session, you will be faced with a temptation - RStudio will ask whether you want to save your workspace.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a script, a project, and a workspace? A script contains the code which tells R what you want it to do. Script commands are run in the console in the order they are written. You want to get in the habit of saving your script files often. Your project file tells R the path to look for files and folders at. This sets a relative path for your work in that project. A workspace file saves the exact image of what’s going on when you close out of RStudio - that may include loaded datasets, functions, and objects.\nYou have likely been tempted to save your workspace when you are closing your R session. While tempting, I encourage you not to get in the habit of saving your workspace. This runs counter to most other interactions you’ve had with computers - saving documents, video games, or survey responses. Saving your workspace can lead to bad habits with regards to reproducibility. You want to allow your scripts to serve as a repository for all steps that go from your raw data to your analysis and outputs. Unless your script has time or computationally intensive steps, your scripts and computer can re-run your workflow to return to the point that you left off when you last worked on the project.\n\n\nLater in the class, we’ll introduce more powerful strategies like the renv and targets packages which can help to manage your workflows and their dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nProject Setup\nEach project you create should have it’s own directory which will be a folder with a descriptive file name. This root folder will contain a directory structure which allows you to organize your data and workflows. There’s no standardized format which this directory structure has to take, however there are some useful principles that will help you stay organized.\n\nProject Organization Principles\n\nUse subdirectories to stay organized. While R doesn’t care whether your project directory contains subdirectories, subdirectories are useful for keeping track of your files. As you build out increasingly complicated projects, you will likelly generate lots of data, metadata, scripts, and outputs. Subdirectories can help you to keep all of this information organized, and will make it easier for others to navigate your project.\nKeep raw and processed data separate. We want to set up workflows that allow us to consistently be able to transition from raw data to processed data, to outputs (that will end up in our outputs folder). If our project relied upon locally stored datasets, raw data should be placed in a separate folder for raw data. After it exists, raw data should only be read - it shouldn’t be written to. Depending upon the considerations of your workflow, you may want to create a separate folder for processed data - unlike your raw data folder, you may both read and write data to this folder.\nMaintain a local copy of data documentation. Whenever possible, download or include data documentation to go along with your raw data. This will be useful to refer to as you’re working, and will also help others who make work on the project in the future. As you modify data and create your own datasets, you should also consider creating documentation for your working data. Again, this will help you or others in the future.\nOutputs get their own subdirectory. Outputs may include tables, graphics, or any other output created by your analysis. Depending upon the quantity of outputs, you may choose to add additional subdirectories to your output folder to help organize your outputs.\nOrder your scripts. In addition to creating a dedicated subdirectory for your scripts, consider naming them in such a way that they are ordered and follow your data workflow. You may also want to develop a master script that sequentially runs your other scripts. You can use source() in this master script to run other scripts.\nQuarto Markdown gets its own subdirectory. Depending upon the complexity of your project, it may be useful to creata a directory for any Quarto Markdown documents you create.\n\nYour base project directory and structure will end up looking something like this:\nRoot\n |\n |_ data\n |   |_ data_raw\n |   |_ data_processed\n |\n |_ documentation\n |_ output\n |_ scripts\n |   |_ 01_master.r\n |   |_ 02_get_data.r\n |   |_ 03_plots.r\n |_ quarto\nAgain, there’s no standardized format which your directory structure has to take. Your structure may also change depending upon the specific considerations and workflows involved for a given project. Over time, you’ll develop a default folder structure that makes sense for how you tend to work.\n\nWhen we assess your work in UP 570, we will be looking for evidence that you are making effective use of project directory structures. Unless we state so, there’s no required directory structure format, however, we want to see you applying principles of good directory management in your work.\n\n\n\nProject Organization Workflows\nAfter we create our project directory and create a r project file, we can programmatically create our directory structure using the dir.create() command. For example:\n\n\nCode\n# Create project subdirectories\n\ndir.create(\"data\")\ndir.create(\"data/data_raw\")\ndir.create(\"data/data_processed\")\ndir.create(\"documentation\")\ndir.create(\"output\")\ndir.create(\"scripts\")\ndir.create(\"quarto\")\n\n\nWe could also save ourselves repetition in our code using the base R lapply() syntax. We create a list with our project directory names and assign that into an object. We then feel lapply() the list along with the function we wish to apply to each element of that list - in this case, dir.create():\n\n\nCode\n# Create project subdirectories\n\nproject_dirs <- c(\"data\", \"data/data_raw\", \"data/data_processed\", \"documentation\", \"output\", \"scripts\", \"quarto\")\n\nlapply(project_dirs, dir.create)\n\n\n\n\nScript Headers and Structure\nWhile a lot of our coding can be done directly in Quarto Markdown documents, you’ll also want to use scripts to store code and develop workflows that may eventually be represented as output in your Quarto document. Script headers can help to organize the work we do in scripts, and can help when we get ready to share our work with others or pick up work on files we have not looked at in a while.\nTaking a few extra minutes to develop a nice script header will be beneficial in the future - your future self, your collaborators, and others who use your code will appreciate it!\nLike so many other R things, there’s no standardized example of what a script header needs to include, howevver, here’s a basic header template to start with:\n\n\nCode\n# Title: [Insert script title here]\n# Author: [Your name]\n# Email: [Your email address]\n# Date: [Insert date here]\n\n# Script Name: [Script Name]\n\n# Description: [Insert a brief description of the script and its purpose]\n\n# Notes: [Insert any process notes or potential revision plans here]\n\n# Set up the working environment\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(library1)\nlibrary(library2)\n\n# Set global options\noptions(option1 = value1, option2 = value2)\n\n# Define functions\nfunction1 <- function(input1, input2) {\n  # function code goes here\n}\n\nfunction2 <- function(input1, input2) {\n  # function code goes here\n}\n\n# Main script\n\n# End of script\n\n\nThe different elements here help record who coded the script, what it is designed to do, and provides a common place to set options, load packages, and define functions. Although these components could occur anywhere in the script before they are called upon, includig them in the header helps track what’s going on in the script.\nWhile you could easily type out each element of your header every time that you develop a new script, you can also save your script as a code snippet within RStudio, which will allow you to easily insert the header template into new scripts you create.\n\n\nThis code snippet trick is paraphrased from the description provided by Dr. Timothy S. Farewell.\n\nIn RStudio, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Code -> Snippets -> Edit Snippets. This will bring up a block of code - scroll to the bottom.\nModify the below code header template to include your information and then copy / paste this into the snippets code block.\n\n\n\nCode\nsnippet header\n    # Title: \n    # Author:\n    # Email:\n    # Date:\n\n    # Script Name:\n\n    # Description:\n\n    # Notes:\n\n    # Working Environment Setup\n\n    # Load required libraries\n    load_packages <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"sf\") # Add more packages here as needed\n    lapply(load_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)\n\n    # Set global options\n\n    # Define functions\n\n\n 3. Save and close the window.\nYou have now added this snippet to your library. When you start a new script, simply type “header” and press tab and RStudio will fill in your header template.\n\n\nSnippets are handy - you may soon identify other common bits of code that you use frequently that you want to make snippets out of.\n\n\nNaming Files\nAs mentioned in the Project Organization Principles section, it’s important to spend a little time thinking about conventions for your filenames. Some useful principles:\n\nAvoid using special characters (for instance, \\ / : * ? ” < > |) in file names.\nDo not use spaces in filenames. You may use an underscore (e.g. map_census_tracts.png) to help with readability.\nIf you choose to use dates as part of your filename, order them yyy-mm-dd (e.g. 20230102 would be January 2, 2023). If you have multiple versions of the file from different dates, this ensures that your files will be properly ordered by the date.\n\n\n\nThis date format (yyy-mm-dd) conforms to ISO 8601 format.\n\nWhen creating ordered lists for file names (ordered by number) use at least two digits (e.g. “01_Main”, “02_Download”, “03_Map”). This will keep your files in order once you get past 10."

This file will be formatted to include citation references.\nA bibliographic data source, typically a Bibtex (.bibtex) file.\nA csl file - this specifies the format for your bibliography. You can find and include different csl files to produce a bibliography using different reference styles.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a bibliography file.\nUsing a text editor, create a plain text file that will contain your bibliographic references. In this case, we’ll create a text file called “references.bib”. Note that this file should end in .bib to signify that it is a bibliographic reference file.\n\n\nStep 2: Refer to the bibliography file in your YAML Header\nNext, in your Quarto Markdown document, you’ll add a line to your YAML header that refers to the location and name of your bibliography file.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define a citation style\nLike most other reference management systems, you can define what reference syle your references will be rendered as, and change this as needed. The Citation Style Language (CSL) project defines a common language and structure for styles. These are stored in .csl files which you will associate with your document. You can find and download .csl files in a range of formats from the CSL Project’s repository.\n\n\nYou can also find and download csl files in Zotero’s style repository. If you hover over a style format, it provides examples of what a citation will look like in your redered document.\nFor the sake of example, we’ll format our document using American Psychological Association (APA) format. We’ll search the CSL Project’s repository to find an appropriate APA style .csl file. Once you find the appropriate file, then download the file and place it in the same directory as our .bib file.\n Click on the .csl style format you want to use. You’ll then be taken to a page that includes the specific file’s contents.\n\nFrom here, you can right click on the button that says “raw” and download the .csl file.\n Note that before you move this file from your download folder to the folder where your .bib file is located, you may need to alter the file extension to indicate that this is a .csl file. Once you have done this, move it to the folder where your .bib file is located and then add a csl reference to your YAML header.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa-6th-edition.csl\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Add references to your document\nYou’re now set up to add references to your document. You can add references in lots of different ways. If you’re searching for references using a service like Google Scholar, under the “cite” options for a given reference, you’ll see a URL to download the BibTeX citation associated with that reference.\n Click on BibTeX and the citation contents will show:\n\nCopy this text, and paste it into your bibliographic reference file (in our example, references.bib).\n\nYou can then cite this reference while you write by referring to it as follows:\n\n\nCode\n[@healy2018data] provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\n\n\n(Healy, 2018) provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\nNote that the actual reference corresponds to the first clause in the bibtex reference.\n\n\nYou can change the reference name if you’d like to something you’ll remember as you cite.\nYou can paste more references into the same references.bib file and cite them as well.\n\n\nYou can find more details on formatting citations on the Quarto website.\nOnline tools like Citation Machine can help you to build references for a range of online sources. (Feder, n.d.) takes a little while to get used to, but these tools can help you to build out an effective citation workflow.\n\n\nStep 5: Place your bibliography\nQuarto will automatically place your references at the end of your document (or wherever your style definition file calls for references to be placed). You can also explicitly tell Quarto where to place your references by creating a div as follows:\n\n\nCode\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\nYou should end up with a formatted reference section at the end of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Considerations\nIt’s ultimately up to you how you manage and generate references within your documents. If you have a document with very few references, footnotes and/or endnotes may be an appropriate strategy. A more complex document with many references may be better managed using BibTeX. You can also use another reference management system and then export citations in BibTeX format which can then be added to your Quarto Markdown document."
