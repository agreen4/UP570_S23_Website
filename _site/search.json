We will use reading and reflection to help us contextualize our understanding of neighborhoods, however, our focus will be on learning by doing. Our class will meet in person twice per week - Tuesdays will typically be devoted to introducing and discussing new information, and Thursdays will typically be devoted to labs and independent work.\nUnless otherwise noted, please plan on bringing to class a computer that will run R and RStudio (available for PC/Mac/Linux) and for which you have administrative privileges.\n\nWhat to Expect from Me\n\nOffice Hours and Availability: Please make an appointment to speak one-on-one using my Calendly page. Of course, I’m also happy to chat either before or after our class if i’m available.\nEmail: The easiest way to communicate with me outside of class is via email. I try to respond to emails sent during the week within 24 hours. Emails sent over the weekend will receive a response within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from me after that amount of time, it’s okay to nudge me to respond.\nTroubleshooting: Plan on using our class Slack channel, email, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. The Resources page provides thoughts and resources for troubleshooting. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.\n\n\n\nWhat I Expect From You\n\nBe Present: I expect that you’ll engage fully in our course sessions and in our class community.\nActively Support Each Other: I expect that each of you will take on individual leadership roles within our class, that includes actively supporting our learning community over the course of the semester. This class assumes collaboration and sharing as part of our learning model.\nRead with Care: This course focuses on learning by doing, however, there are important details contained within the documentation on our course website and within reading selections. Details matter in this class - be intentional about reading carefully and completely important course documents (including this syllabus).\nAct with Integrity: I expect that you will act with integrity in all that you do in this class. The class contract grading system places trust in you to not just meet the nominal standards contained within the contract, but to push yourself to produce your best work.\nSeek Balance: I expect that you’ll actively work to find balance between the many demands in your life. This means budgeting adequate time to engage fully in our course but also budgeting time for adequate rest and sleep, exercise, and other actions that support your mental and physical health.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nUP 570: Neighborhood Analysis is open to students with graduate-level standing. The course assumes that you have previously taken UP 517: Data Science for Planners or have substantial experience with manipulating data in R.\nPlease talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you."

The place you select will be the location that you focus your social, economic, and demographic analysis on. Given the structure of this class, you need to choose a location in the United States.\nYour work will include thinking about how that place fits within its larger “region.” What do we mean by “place”? It might be a city or town—the City of Champaign—or even twin cities—the cities of Champaign and Urbana. It could also be a county. For our purposes, it is not an entire metropolitan area or a larger macro region (such as the Great Plains or Mississippi Delta)."

    "section": "Place Selection Considerations",
    "text": "Place Selection Considerations\n\nBig places—the cities of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York—are interesting. They are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse and it is usually not hard to find “stories in the data” with respect to neighborhood trends. However, large cities are very complex. Properly understanding the past, present, and future of such places and their neighborhoods can be a herculean task. Unless you are very familiar with a big place, we suggest focusing on a smaller place.\nMany of the techniques you will learn use methods that draw on data available at the census tract level, as census tracts are frequently used as (imperfect) proxies for neighborhoods. As you work to select your place, it may be useful to identify the number of census tracts that overlap. As a rule of thumb, your place should have no fewer than 15 tracts. More is certainly ok, but let’s talk if you are considering a place with fewer than 15 tracts.\nConsider selecting a place in a broader area of particular policy concern, such as an economically distressed region (central Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, or the Black Belt). Many communities in the Great Plains and Mountain states are not distressed by conventional measures but they face significant out-migration and population decline, which introduce their own challenges at the local level. Places around international borders can also be interesting to examine.\nConsider selecting a place within driving distance of Champaign-Urbana (although you may not select Champaign County or it’s constituent cities as your place). Making a site visit to the county and its principal urban centers could help you understand its conditions and context better, giving you the ability to write about it with more authority.\nHaving some personal experience in the place you select can be helpful. Many students select their hometown or other community/county in which they have lived, provided the criteria above are satisfied. Some students also select places there are interested in living or working in.\nIslands and territories (such as Puerto Rico and Hawaii) and remote areas (such as Alaska) are interesting, but geography and data availability can make them challenging places to analyze. Students have analyzed all of these places in recent years- but with extra effort needed to address data gaps and limitations. You may want to explore these issues before committing to one of these places.\nIf you have any questions about the places you are considering, or you wish to talk through your choices, please talk with me."

Your narrative does not have to be long, but it should help to contextualize the questions you are engaging with and the methods you use to engage those questions.\nMethods and Approach: Describe your approach to analysis - what is the specific question or problem you are taking on? What precedents or work that others have done is helping to inform your approach? Why is the selected geographic scale of your analysis appropriate?\nData Sources: Describe the data source(s) that you are using for your analysis. Where are these data coming from?

    "text": "R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines. This means that in addition to being free and available for a range of operating systems and environments, R is also directly supported by a diverse user community who continually develop approaches for specialized applications or data. Need to download U.S. Census Data? There’s an R package for that. Need to perform common data cleaning tasks? There’s an R package for that too. We’ll be exploring a range of these specialized applications over the course of the semester.\nOf course there are alternate languages which we could employ in service of neighborhood analysis. Python, for example, is an even more ubiquitous programming language with its own set of tools for data science. R was originally built as a statistical computing language, and that brings some important benefits for the types of data science we’ll be learning this semester. R is also fairly prevalent among the user community working in public policy analysis and urban data science - this is the user community which you will be joining. Finally, R has a high learning curve, but also a very active user community, meaning that abundant documentation of problems and their solutions is available.\nAs we get started, let’s be clear - you are going to experience some frustration and challenges as you learn the R programming language. This class assumes no prior background in R or any other programming language for that matter, and we’ll work to quickly build your “vocabulary” and the ability to get results. We will spend some time picking up basics, and will then use our exploration of specific analysis approaches to reinforce our use of the grammar and structure of the language and to build more complex scripts over time.\nIt’s fair to equate learning R with learning to drive a manual car. Increasingly, people learn how to drive in automatic cars - essentially allowing the car to handle the function of switching gears - you put the car into drive, press the accelerator pedal and the car moves forward. Your past exposure to computer-based analytic tools has probably followed a similar strategy - you likely learned using software that had graphical user interfaces that allow them to call up and run programs and then spit out results. Most of us learn to point and click in order to accomplish a particular set of analytic tasks, meaning that if we want to generate the same results in the future, we would have to repeat all of those same steps over again.\nSo why learn on a manual? For many car enthusiasts, manuals are both more efficient and more engaging to drive - they offer additional control, and come with a heightened awareness of what the car is doing. Of course, they also come with a steep learning curve.\nSome of the same attributes apply to our use of R as a tool for analysis.\n\nFirst, a manual approach forces you to explicitly understand more of the requirements and assumptions that go into the analysis that you’re doing.\nSecond, you have to know your data (and its strengths and limitations) well in order to get it set up for analysis and to produce useful output.\nThird, this approach emphasizes reproducible analysis, meaning that you will develop workflows that can be repeated over and over again producing the same results - important for sharing your work with others and for accountability, especially within contexts related to public deliberation of the strengths and weaknesses of policy arguments.\n\nKeeping these three benefits in mind, we’ll be using the R software coupled with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to counter some of the downsides of a purely manual approach. RStudio will help us implement R code more effectively and efficiently. Hopefully at this point, this prospect leaves you excited rather than daunted!"

You may also choose from an alternate installer if you believe it is more appropriate for your operating system.\nDownload and install RStudio, again using the default installation settings.\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open RStudio. You should see something that looks like this (the information in your console window will likely describe a newer version of R than what is displayed here).\n\nYou’ll note that what appears in the portion of the console to the left looks very similar to the R console window which you opened before you started your install of RStudio. This console functions in exactly the same way, however, you’ll also note that there are other areas which you have access to as well.\n## Rtools error (PC users)\nSome PC users may encounter an error message regarding Rtools not being installed. This would come up with you first try to install a package such as tidyverse either using R’s package manager or using the install.packages() command. To remedy this error if it occurs, PC users need to close R, manually download a patch, install it, and restart your computer. This error should then be remedied.\nIf you are a PC user who encounters this error, please do the following: 1. Save any work and close your RStudio session 2. Download Rtools (download link) + the link above contains instructions for putting Rtools on the PATH - you should not need to do this. 3. Run the downloaded executable file to install Rtools 4. Restart your computer 5. Re-open RStudio - the problem should be resolved"

Your memorandum should provide some general background on your place, and should then identify one or several key issues that will guide your subsequent analysis and work over the course of the semester. Key issues should be guided by a combination of your interests and what you can justify as relevant given your background research.\nBelow, please find some guiding questions to help you structure your memorandum:\n\nWhat is the overall history of your place? What are the types of issues that have mattered in the past, and what types of issues matter at present?\nWhich neighborhoods or subareas of your place are frequently mentioned in local plans, reports, or journalistic accounts? What differentiates those neighborhoods? At what geographic scale can these subareas be classified or analyzed?\nBased upon your background research, are there any population groups that are likely to warrant special attention. Why?\nBased upon your background research, are there policy issues or debates that warrant special attention or that could benefit from detailed analysis. What are these, and what factors are important for understanding them?\nBased upon your exploration, identify key themes and indicators which you believe will be important to focus on in your subsequent analyses. What types of strategies do you intend to use in order to examine these themes and indicators?"

Your memorandum should summarize for your place major characteristics and trends in:\n\nPopulation and population change;\nRacial and ethnic composition;\nAge structure;\nIncome, wages, and poverty;\nEducational attainment and employment by industry\n\nThe objective is to provide a clear portrait of the demographic characteristics of your place and how they are changing over time and space. Support your discussion with tables and figures as appropriate, and include at least one map displaying the geography of your place."

    "text": "Memorandum Preparation Tips\n\nProvide some context, namely information on the area’s physical features and a very brief history. This does not need to be done in a separate section and it should not adopt the “booster” language of your typical Chamber of Commerce brochure. Sometimes it can be accomplished in a sentence or two, or in a few well-placed sentences in the report.\nLook for a story line in the data. Often there are some important local trends (sustained economic distress, rapid economic growth, high rates of international migration, etc.) that provide a good organizing framework for more specific social and demographic trends.\nYou already have most of the data and code you need from class lab sessions. You should plan on drawing from these, but also expanding upon them. Expansion may mean looking at data sources or indicators we have not explored before. We are looking for evidence that you are using the most appropriate information to follow through on your lines of argumentation. What is important is dictated by… your place!\nLikewise, you are not required to include all of the types of tables, graphics, and analyses you produced for the prior exercises. Now is the time to narrow your focus to the most significant local characteristics and trends.\nFeel free to incorporate other material (e.g., existing studies or reports) that will help you provide context for your discussion or help you interpret trends. Cite accordingly.\nYou should strive to write this memorandum in fewer than 2,000 words, not including references, tables, and figures. Two thousand words is a maximum, not a minimum. Follow the strategies for effective professional writing—including use of active headings and concise reporting of trends—to convey the information concisely."

Please rely upon each other as peer reviewers and on your instructors for help in identifying an appropriate policy or research question to focus your memorandum on.\nPolicy analysis depends upon following a logical chain of thought through existing policies and questions. Be sure to review and understand these before attempting to develop your own approach. Please also think carefully and critically about how your your chosen analysis may iterate over various neighborhoods in your place.\nAt this point in the semester, we expect to see refined maps, data visualizations, and tables in your memos. Please allocate appropriate time to working on these elements of your memo.\nThink through how the story of your policy analysis relates back to the other stories you’ve told in subsequent memos over the course of the semester. Your final assignment depends upon you integrating these items into a final policy report, so having a good understanding of how these stories are related will make it easier to develop a coherent narrative in your final report."
