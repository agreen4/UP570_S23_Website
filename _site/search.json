Of course, I’m also happy to chat either before or after our class if i’m available.\nEmail: The easiest way to communicate with me outside of class is via email. I try to respond to emails sent during the week within 24 hours. Emails sent over the weekend will receive a response within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from me after that amount of time, it’s okay to nudge me to respond.\nTroubleshooting: Plan on using our class Slack channel, email, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. The Resources page provides thoughts and resources for troubleshooting. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.\n\n\n\nWhat I Expect From You\n\nBe Present: I expect that you’ll engage fully in our course sessions and in our class community.\nActively Support Each Other: I expect that each of you will take on individual leadership roles within our class, that includes actively supporting our learning community over the course of the semester. This class assumes collaboration and sharing as part of our learning model.\nRead with Care: This course focuses on learning by doing, however, there are important details contained within the documentation on our course website and within reading selections. Details matter in this class - be intentional about reading carefully and completely important course documents (including this syllabus).\nAct with Integrity: I expect that you will act with integrity in all that you do in this class. The class contract grading system places trust in you to not just meet the nominal standards contained within the contract, but to push yourself to produce your best work.\nSeek Balance: I expect that you’ll actively work to find balance between the many demands in your life. This means budgeting adequate time to engage fully in our course but also budgeting time for adequate rest and sleep, exercise, and other actions that support your mental and physical health.\n\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nUP 570: Neighborhood Analysis is open to students with graduate-level standing. The course assumes that you have previously taken UP 517: Data Science for Planners or have substantial experience with manipulating data in R.\nPlease talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you."

The place you select will be the location that you focus your social, economic, and demographic analysis on. Given the structure of this class, you need to choose a location in the United States.\nYour work will include thinking about how that place fits within its larger “region.” What do we mean by “place”? It might be a city or town—the City of Champaign—or even twin cities—the cities of Champaign and Urbana. It could also be a county. For our purposes, it is not an entire metropolitan area or a larger macro region (such as the Great Plains or Mississippi Delta)."

    "section": "Place Selection Considerations",
    "text": "Place Selection Considerations\n\nBig places—the cities of Chicago, Los Angeles, New York—are interesting. They are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse and it is usually not hard to find “stories in the data” with respect to neighborhood trends. However, large cities are very complex. Properly understanding the past, present, and future of such places and their neighborhoods can be a herculean task. Unless you are very familiar with a big place, we suggest focusing on a smaller place.\nMany of the techniques you will learn use methods that draw on data available at the census tract level, as census tracts are frequently used as (imperfect) proxies for neighborhoods. As you work to select your place, it may be useful to identify the number of census tracts that overlap. As a rule of thumb, your place should have no fewer than 15 tracts. More is certainly ok, but let’s talk if you are considering a place with fewer than 15 tracts.\nConsider selecting a place in a broader area of particular policy concern, such as an economically distressed region (central Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, or the Black Belt). Many communities in the Great Plains and Mountain states are not distressed by conventional measures but they face significant out-migration and population decline, which introduce their own challenges at the local level. Places around international borders can also be interesting to examine.\nConsider selecting a place within driving distance of Champaign-Urbana (although you may not select Champaign County or it’s constituent cities as your place). Making a site visit to the county and its principal urban centers could help you understand its conditions and context better, giving you the ability to write about it with more authority.\nHaving some personal experience in the place you select can be helpful. Many students select their hometown or other community/county in which they have lived, provided the criteria above are satisfied. Some students also select places there are interested in living or working in.\nIslands and territories (such as Puerto Rico and Hawaii) and remote areas (such as Alaska) are interesting, but geography and data availability can make them challenging places to analyze. Students have analyzed all of these places in recent years- but with extra effort needed to address data gaps and limitations. You may want to explore these issues before committing to one of these places.\nIf you have any questions about the places you are considering, or you wish to talk through your choices, please talk with me."

Your narrative does not have to be long, but it should help to contextualize the questions you are engaging with and the methods you use to engage those questions.\nMethods and Approach: Describe your approach to analysis - what is the specific question or problem you are taking on? What precedents or work that others have done is helping to inform your approach? Why is the selected geographic scale of your analysis appropriate?\nData Sources: Describe the data source(s) that you are using for your analysis. Where are these data coming from?

That’s a given, and is an expected part of learning in this class. Part of the goal is to teach you how to understand the intentionality and logic behind the software so that you can anticipate where errors are likely to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiential Learning\n\n\n\nThe only way to do this is to encounter errors - and there will be many!\n\n\nYou are entering an intermediate to advanced stage of learning a new language, it’s grammar, and its application. While this will be frustrating at times, there is a major payoff in the capacity you will gain in analytic skills and problem-solving. This payoff will come slowly over time - do not expect it to come easily.\n\nYou are not alone in this struggle. In addition to your classmates and others who are going through the same thing, there is a large R user community, and lots of existing documentation and troubleshooting. Any problem you will encounter has likely been encountered and addressed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen I run into an error, after an initial check for simple issues like closing parentheses and spelling errors, I copy and paste error codes directly into a web search to see how others have dealt with similar problems. I encourage you to do the same.\n\n\nYou got this, and there will be a payoff, so long as you use the tools consistently - I promise!\n\n\nWe’re Here For You\nWe’ve been living in particularly abnormal times for the last few years - while for many, things are improving, it would be irresponsible to expect that teaching and learning would occur “normally” right now. We continue to teach and learn under emergency circumstances.\nAs you face challenges this semester (and beyond) I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can."

    "text": "R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines. This means that in addition to being free and available for a range of operating systems and environments, R is also directly supported by a diverse user community who continually develop approaches for specialized applications or data. Need to download U.S. Census Data? There’s an R package for that. Need to perform common data cleaning tasks? There’s an R package for that too. We’ll be exploring a range of these specialized applications over the course of the semester.\nOf course there are alternate languages which we could employ in service of neighborhood analysis. Python, for example, is an even more ubiquitous programming language with its own set of tools for data science. R was originally built as a statistical computing language, and that brings some important benefits for the types of data science we’ll be learning this semester. R is also fairly prevalent among the user community working in public policy analysis and urban data science - this is the user community which you will be joining. Finally, R has a high learning curve, but also a very active user community, meaning that abundant documentation of problems and their solutions is available.\nAs we get started, let’s be clear - you are going to experience some frustration and challenges as you learn the R programming language. This class assumes no prior background in R or any other programming language for that matter, and we’ll work to quickly build your “vocabulary” and the ability to get results. We will spend some time picking up basics, and will then use our exploration of specific analysis approaches to reinforce our use of the grammar and structure of the language and to build more complex scripts over time.\nIt’s fair to equate learning R with learning to drive a manual car. Increasingly, people learn how to drive in automatic cars - essentially allowing the car to handle the function of switching gears - you put the car into drive, press the accelerator pedal and the car moves forward. Your past exposure to computer-based analytic tools has probably followed a similar strategy - you likely learned using software that had graphical user interfaces that allow them to call up and run programs and then spit out results. Most of us learn to point and click in order to accomplish a particular set of analytic tasks, meaning that if we want to generate the same results in the future, we would have to repeat all of those same steps over again.\nSo why learn on a manual? For many car enthusiasts, manuals are both more efficient and more engaging to drive - they offer additional control, and come with a heightened awareness of what the car is doing. Of course, they also come with a steep learning curve.\nSome of the same attributes apply to our use of R as a tool for analysis:\n\nFirst, a manual approach forces you to explicitly understand more of the requirements and assumptions that go into the analysis that you’re doing.\nSecond, you have to know your data (and its strengths and limitations) well in order to get it set up for analysis and to produce useful output.\nThird, this approach emphasizes reproducible analysis, meaning that you will develop workflows that can be repeated over and over again producing the same results - important for sharing your work with others and for accountability, especially within contexts related to public deliberation of the strengths and weaknesses of policy arguments.\n\nKeeping these three benefits in mind, we’ll be using the R software coupled with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to counter some of the downsides of a purely manual approach. RStudio will help us implement R code more effectively and efficiently. Hopefully at this point, this prospect leaves you excited rather than daunted!"

You may also choose from an alternate installer if you believe it is more appropriate for your operating system.\nDownload and install RStudio, again using the default installation settings.\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open RStudio. You should see something that looks like this (the information in your console window will likely describe a newer version of R than what is displayed here).\n\nYou’ll note that what appears in the portion of the console to the left looks very similar to the R console window which you opened before you started your install of RStudio. This console functions in exactly the same way, however, you’ll also note that there are other areas which you have access to as well.\n## Rtools error (PC users)\nSome PC users may encounter an error message regarding Rtools not being installed. This would come up with you first try to install a package such as tidyverse either using R’s package manager or using the install.packages() command. To remedy this error if it occurs, PC users need to close R, manually download a patch, install it, and restart your computer. This error should then be remedied.\nIf you are a PC user who encounters this error, please do the following: 1. Save any work and close your RStudio session 2. Download Rtools (download link) + the link above contains instructions for putting Rtools on the PATH - you should not need to do this. 3. Run the downloaded executable file to install Rtools 4. Restart your computer 5. Re-open RStudio - the problem should be resolved"

    "text": "The Lab\n\n\nFile System and Structure\nWhen you started learning R and RStudio, you likely struggled a bit with some of the core concepts related to how R views your computer’s file system and where it looks for files and stores work. There’s nothing to complex about what R is doing, but as computers have become better at making sensible decisions for us, it can be easy to lose track of some of the basics of how we need to set up file structures that help us to actively manage our workflows and outputs.\nThere are a few basics which we need to have down. The first is a gentle reminder about how computer file systems work. Back when I was a kid in the early 1980s, the primary way we interacted with computers was at the command line. When you started a computer, you might be greeted with something that looks like the terminal tab in your RStudio session:\n From here, you’d type commands to either navigate between directories, list files in a directory, or execute files. For instance, we can use ls to list all the files in my home directory: \nAnd then take a look at the results: \nWhich is the equivalent of looking at what files are in my computer’s home directory in a graphical user interface: \nWhile for the most part we wont be bothered with accessing our file system this way, it’s useful to understand what’s going on with the pathnames that are shown. Whether you’re used to working with Mac, PC, or Linux operating systems, the approach to file systems is sufficiently similar to talk about them all together.\nMost modern operating systems operate using relative pathnames which allow us to be more efficient in referencing where files are located in our computer. The path that you saw above on my computer points to the “home directory” which is the base directory associated with my user account on the computer. My home director is situated however within other directories that are part of the operating system and that are ultimately on a hard disk drive.\n So why is all of this important? This underscores the rationale for and utility of relative paths in our filesystem. My mac computer’s home directory is Machinsosh HD/Users/andrewgreenlee/ which means that rather than having to type out all of that content, I can just start instructions to paths beloww that directory. For instance, let’s navigate to my desktop folder: \nWhich is the same as navigating from the root folder of our hard drive to the desktop folder: \nThis certainly makes things more convenient for navigating files in Terminal and in our file system. It has a much deeper utulity when we are thinking about reproducible data analysis. Let’s explore in more detail.\n\nDirectory Structure and R\nOFtentimes when people begin learning in R and RStudio, they simply open the program and start typing commands. This works well up until the point when one needs to get data into or out of R. In general, R is agnostic about where to look for files - if you open RStudio without specifying where to look for files, it assumes you want to work out of your home directory (the getwd() command returns the current working directory R is using): \nWe typically do not want to work out of our home directory, but would like to set another directory to work out of. When new R users start to work in R, many are taught to use setwd() to explicitly set a directory to work out of. This will work, and sets a “home” directory for the particular work you are doing.\n\nsetwd(\"Desktop/andrew-home/neighborhood_types/\")\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let’s say we wnat to open a dataset containing a list of community area definitions for Chicago:\n\ndataset <- read.csv(\"CommAreas.csv\")\ndataset\n\nWe create a script in our working directory that sets the directory, reads the file, and then shows the file to us.\nWhat happens when you move your working folder to another computer or share it? If you explicitly set your working directory, it won’t be able to access that directory which is at a path that doesn’t exist on your other computer:\n R Projects help us to address this problem. Projects add a file to the folder we wish to set as our home directory for our project which establishes where R will look for files.\nIn the right top corner of your RStudio window, you’ll note a blue cube which leads to a project management menu:\n If you click “New Project”, a dialog box will open up which allows you to specify project options:\n\nYou have options here - you can either create a new project in a new folder, use an existing folder which you’ve already created, or check a project out from Github or another vesion control system. Since we already have a directory we’ve been working out of, we can use the existing directory dialog, and then set the directory where our script and data are located.\n\nFrom here, so long as we open our work by clicking on the project file, we’ll be taken into the project which will remember what the “home” directory is for our work. \nThe benefit of this approach is that if we move our project directory to another computer and open our project, R understands that the folder with the project file reflects the relative path to where we will find the other files referenced in our project. This means that if we share our working folder with others, they can reproduce what we did so long as all files are contained within that project directory.\nProject files represent mileposts that set the relative path at which RStudio will look for files within our particular project. This is useful for creating a project file structure within which we can create reproducible and easily shareable analysis. You should be in the habit of starting each new analysis you do by setting up a new work folder with a new project file.\n\n\n\nProjects vs. Workspaces\nEach time you close your RStudio session, you will be faced with a temptation - RStudio will ask whether you want to save your workspace.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a script, a project, and a workspace? A script contains the code which tells R what you want it to do. Script commands are run in the console in the order they are written. You want to get in the habit of saving your script files often. Your project file tells R the path to look for files and folders at. This sets a relative path for your work in that project. A workspace file saves the exact image of what’s going on when you close out of RStudio - that may include loaded datasets, functions, and objects.\nYou have likely been tempted to save your workspace when you are closing your R session. While tempting, I encourage you not to get in the habit of saving your workspace. This runs counter to most other interactions you’ve had with computers - saving documents, video games, or survey responses. Saving your workspace can lead to bad habits with regards to reproducibility. You want to allow your scripts to serve as a repository for all steps that go from your raw data to your analysis and outputs. Unless your script has time or computationally intensive steps, your scripts and computer can re-run your workflow to return to the point that you left off when you last worked on the project.\n\n\nLater in the class, we’ll introduce more powerful strategies like the renv and Targets packages which can help to manage your workflows and their dependencies.\nMore Here"

For instance, let’s navigate to my desktop folder: \nWhich is the same as navigating from the root folder of our hard drive to the desktop folder: \nThis certainly makes things more convenient for navigating files in Terminal and in our file system. It has a much deeper utulity when we are thinking about reproducible data analysis. Let’s explore in more detail.\n\nDirectory Structure and R\nOftentimes when people begin learning in R and RStudio, they simply open the program and start typing commands. This works well up until the point when one needs to get data into or out of R. In general, R is agnostic about where to look for files - if you open RStudio without specifying where to look for files, it assumes you want to work out of your home directory (the getwd() command returns the current working directory R is using): \nWe typically do not want to work out of our home directory, but would like to set another directory to work out of. When new R users start to work in R, many are taught to use setwd() to explicitly set a directory to work out of. This will work, and sets a “home” directory for the particular work you are doing.\n\n\nCode\nsetwd(\"Desktop/andrew-home/neighborhood_types/\")\n\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let’s say we wnat to open a dataset containing a list of community area definitions for Chicago:\n\n\nCode\ndataset <- read.csv(\"CommAreas.csv\")\ndataset\n\n\nWe create a script in our working directory that sets the directory, reads the file, and then shows the file to us.\nWhat happens when you move your working folder to another computer or share it? If you explicitly set your working directory, it won’t be able to access that directory which is at a path that doesn’t exist on your other computer:\n R Projects help us to address this problem. Projects add a file to the folder we wish to set as our home directory for our project which establishes where R will look for files.\nIn the right top corner of your RStudio window, you’ll note a blue cube which leads to a project management menu:\n If you click “New Project”, a dialog box will open up which allows you to specify project options:\n\nYou have options here - you can either create a new project in a new folder, use an existing folder which you’ve already created, or check a project out from Github or another vesion control system. Since we already have a directory we’ve been working out of, we can use the existing directory dialog, and then set the directory where our script and data are located.\n\nFrom here, so long as we open our work by clicking on the project file, we’ll be taken into the project which will remember what the “home” directory is for our work. \nThe benefit of this approach is that if we move our project directory to another computer and open our project, R understands that the folder with the project file reflects the relative path to where we will find the other files referenced in our project. This means that if we share our working folder with others, they can reproduce what we did so long as all files are contained within that project directory.\nProject files represent mileposts that set the relative path at which RStudio will look for files within our particular project. This is useful for creating a project file structure within which we can create reproducible and easily shareable analysis. You should be in the habit of starting each new analysis you do by setting up a new work folder with a new project file.\n\n\nProjects vs. Workspaces\nEach time you close your RStudio session, you will be faced with a temptation - RStudio will ask whether you want to save your workspace.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a script, a project, and a workspace? A script contains the code which tells R what you want it to do. Script commands are run in the console in the order they are written. You want to get in the habit of saving your script files often. Your project file tells R the path to look for files and folders at. This sets a relative path for your work in that project. A workspace file saves the exact image of what’s going on when you close out of RStudio - that may include loaded datasets, functions, and objects.\nYou have likely been tempted to save your workspace when you are closing your R session. While tempting, I encourage you not to get in the habit of saving your workspace. This runs counter to most other interactions you’ve had with computers - saving documents, video games, or survey responses. Saving your workspace can lead to bad habits with regards to reproducibility. You want to allow your scripts to serve as a repository for all steps that go from your raw data to your analysis and outputs. Unless your script has time or computationally intensive steps, your scripts and computer can re-run your workflow to return to the point that you left off when you last worked on the project.\n\n\nLater in the class, we’ll introduce more powerful strategies like the renv and Targets packages which can help to manage your workflows and their dependencies."

    "section": "Working in Quarto",
    "text": "Working in Quarto\nQuarto is a tool built into RStudio which allows you to create a variety of documents that can integrate plain text and code. It’s utility comes both in it’s ability to translate plain text into a variety of well-formatted outputs, but also due to the ease with which we can use this format to share code, analysis, and writing with others. Most of your written assignments in class will be produced in Quarto, therefore, you’ll want to become familiar with the basic syntax and logic.\nQuarto’s plain text formatting is handled using Markdown syntax which is designed to be simple, easily interpreted as text with formatting in place, and readable on most computers. An increasing number of note systems and word processors have adopted Markdown as their language.\n\n\nSome examples include Bear, Obsidian, Notion, Ulysses. Mentions are not endorsements.\n\nFormatting Your Documents\nQuarto makes use of a modified version of Markdown syntax. The Quarto website maintains excellent documentation regarding basic markdown formatting options as well as Quarto-specific formatting options:\n\nYou should familiarize yourself with how to format text, how to use section headings, and how to link files and insert references to other files.\n\n\nAdding References\nQuarto can help you either manage references in very sinple ways or more complex ways. You can either add references directly to your text as either footnotes or endnotes.\n\nFootnotes\nWe oftentimes use footnotes as an easy way to convey references or links to details or important information that does not need to be in our main body of text. Quarto allows you to create both footnotes and long notes. Footnotes are typically short and take up only a line or two. Long notes are longer and may contain multiple paragraphs.\n  \nHere is some text with a footnote.[^1]\n\n[^1]: And here is the footnote that accompanies that text in the footnotes section.\n\nHere is also some text with an inline footnote.^[Here is the text associated with the inline footnote - this may be easier to track because it is in line with the text.]\n\nHere is some text with a longnote.[^longnote]\n\n[^longnote]: And here is a longnote that takes up multiple lines. You can experiment in your text to see whether a footnote or longnote will serve you better for a given situation.\n  \n  This text is also part of the long note - the indent signals that it remains part of the note.\n  \nAnd this text would be part of the next paragraph that's outside of the note because it is not indented.\nHere is some text with a footnote1\nHere is also some text with an inline footnote.2\nHere is some text with a longnote3\nAnd this text would be part of the next paragraph that’s outside of the note because it is not indented.\n\n\nAsides\nYou can also add asides to documents which places a note in line with text in the margin.\n\n\nFor a very effective example of asides, see Kieran Healy’s book Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.\n:::{.aside}\nHere is an aside placed in line with text in the margin.\n:::\n\n\nHere is an aside placed in line with text in the margin.\n\n\nCitations and Bibliographies\nFor longer or more advanced documents, you may wish to rely upon Quarto’s suppot for using and managing references with BibTex, a standard reference format. This allows you to add references to your document and then create in line citations and a formatted bibliography to accompany your writing.\nIn order to create a bibliography that is associated with a document, you’ll need three files:\n\nA main file written in Quarto Markdown (.qmd). This file will be formatted to include citation references.\nA bibliographic data source, typically a Bibtex (.bibtex) file.\nA csl file - this specifies the format for your bibliography. You can find and include different csl files to produce a bibliography using different reference styles.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a bibliography file.\nUsing a text editor, create a plain text file that will contain your bibliographic references. In this case, we’ll create a text file called “references.bib”. Note that this file should end in .bib to signify that it is a bibliographic reference file.\n\n\nStep 2: Refer to the bibliography file in your YAML Header\nNext, in your Quarto Markdown document, you’ll add a line to your YAML header that refers to the location and name of your bibliography file.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define a citation style\nLike most other reference management systems, you can define what reference syle your references will be rendered as, and change this as needed. The Citation Style Language (CSL) project defines a common language and structure for styles. These are stored in .csl files which you will associate with your document. You can find and download .csl files in a range of formats from the CSL Project’s repository.\n\n\nYou can also find and download csl files in Zotero’s style repository. If you hover over a style format, it provides examples of what a citation will look like in your redered document.\nFor the sake of example, we’ll format our document using American Psychological Association (APA) format. We’ll search the CSL Project’s repository to find an appropriate APA style .csl file. Once you find the appropriate file, then download the file and place it in the same directory as our .bib file.\n Click on the .csl style format you want to use. You’ll then be taken to a page that includes the specific file’s contents.\n\nFrom here, you can right click on the button that says “raw” and download the .csl file.\n Note that before you move this file from your download folder to the folder where your .bib file is located, you may need to alter the file extension to indicate that this is a .csl file. Once you have done this, move it to the folder where your .bib file is located and then add a csl reference to your YAML header.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa-6th-edition.csl\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Add references to your document\nYou’re now set up to add references to your document. You can add references in lots of different ways. If you’re searching for references using a service like Google Scholar, under the “cite” options for a given reference, you’ll see a URL to download the BibTeX citation associated with that reference.\n Click on BibTeX and the citation contents will show:\n\nCopy this text, and paste it into your bibliographic reference file (in our example, references.bib).\n\nYou can then cite this reference while you write by referring to it as follows:\n\n\nCode\n[@healy2018data] provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\n\n\n(Healy, 2018) provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\nNote that the actual reference corresponds to the first clause in the bibtex reference.\n\n\nYou can change the reference name if you’d like to something you’ll remember as you cite.\nYou can paste more references into the same references.bib file and cite them as well.\n\n\nYou can find more details on formatting citations on the Quarto website.\nOnline tools like Citation Machine can help you to build references for a range of online sources. (Feder, n.d.) takes a little while to get used to, but these tools can help you to build out an effective citation workflow.\n\n\nStep 5: Place your bibliography\nQuarto will automatically place your references at the end of your document (or wherever your style definition file calls for references to be placed). You can also explicitly tell Quarto where to place your references by creating a div as follows:\n\n\nCode\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\nYou should end up with a formatted reference section at the end of your document.\n ### Reference Considerations\nIt’s ultimately up to you how you manage and generate references within your documents. If you have a document with very few references, footnotes and/or endnotes may be an appropriate strategy. A more complex document with many references may be better managed using BibTeX. You can also use another reference management system and then export citations in BibTeX format which can then be added to your Quarto Markdown document."

    "text": "Workflow 1: Set up a New Project\nThe first workflow we need to develop is proper project setup in R. In our next lab, we’ll add some more complexity to this project setup by incorporating version control and sharing, but we’ll start by getting a handle on projects that reside on our local computer. Let’s start with a quick review of file system and structure, and then transition into the nuts and bolds of project setup.\n\nFile System and Structure\n\nWhen you started learning R and RStudio, you likely struggled a bit with some of the core concepts related to how R views your computer’s file system and where it looks for files and stores work. There’s nothing to complex about what R is doing, but as computers have become better at making sensible decisions for us, it can be easy to lose track of some of the basics of how we need to set up file structures that help us to actively manage our workflows and outputs.\nThere are a few basics which we need to have down. The first is a gentle reminder about how computer file systems work. Back when I was a kid in the early 1980s, the primary way we interacted with computers was at the command line. When you started a computer, you might be greeted with something that looks like the terminal tab in your RStudio session:\n From here, you’d type commands to either navigate between directories, list files in a directory, or execute files. For instance, we can use ls to list all the files in my home directory: \nAnd then take a look at the results: \nWhich is the equivalent of looking at what files are in my computer’s home directory in a graphical user interface: \nWhile for the most part we wont be bothered with accessing our file system this way, it’s useful to understand what’s going on with the pathnames that are shown. Whether you’re used to working with Mac, PC, or Linux operating systems, the approach to file systems is sufficiently similar to talk about them all together.\nMost modern operating systems operate using relative pathnames which allow us to be more efficient in referencing where files are located in our computer. The path that you saw above on my computer points to the “home directory” which is the base directory associated with my user account on the computer. My home director is situated however within other directories that are part of the operating system and that are ultimately on a hard disk drive.\n So why is all of this important? This underscores the rationale for and utility of relative paths in our filesystem. My mac computer’s home directory is Machinsosh HD/Users/andrewgreenlee/ which means that rather than having to type out all of that content, I can just start instructions to paths beloww that directory. For instance, let’s navigate to my desktop folder: \nWhich is the same as navigating from the root folder of our hard drive to the desktop folder: \nThis certainly makes things more convenient for navigating files in Terminal and in our file system. It has a much deeper utulity when we are thinking about reproducible data analysis.

This will work, and sets a “home” directory for the particular work you are doing.\n\n\nCode\nsetwd(\"Desktop/andrew-home/neighborhood_types/\")\n\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let’s say we wnat to open a dataset containing a list of community area definitions for Chicago:\n\n\nCode\ndataset <- read.csv(\"CommAreas.csv\")\ndataset\n\n\nWe create a script in our working directory that sets the directory, reads the file, and then shows the file to us.\nWhat happens when you move your working folder to another computer or share it?

This is useful for creating a project file structure within which we can create reproducible and easily shareable analysis. You should be in the habit of starting each new analysis you do by setting up a new work folder with a new project file.\n\n\nProjects vs. Workspaces\nEach time you close your RStudio session, you will be faced with a temptation - RStudio will ask whether you want to save your workspace.\n\nWhat’s the difference between a script, a project, and a workspace? A script contains the code which tells R what you want it to do. Script commands are run in the console in the order they are written. You want to get in the habit of saving your script files often. Your project file tells R the path to look for files and folders at. This sets a relative path for your work in that project. A workspace file saves the exact image of what’s going on when you close out of RStudio - that may include loaded datasets, functions, and objects.\nYou have likely been tempted to save your workspace when you are closing your R session. While tempting, I encourage you not to get in the habit of saving your workspace. This runs counter to most other interactions you’ve had with computers - saving documents, video games, or survey responses. Saving your workspace can lead to bad habits with regards to reproducibility. You want to allow your scripts to serve as a repository for all steps that go from your raw data to your analysis and outputs. Unless your script has time or computationally intensive steps, your scripts and computer can re-run your workflow to return to the point that you left off when you last worked on the project.\n\n\nLater in the class, we’ll introduce more powerful strategies like the renv and targets packages which can help to manage your workflows and their dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nProject Setup\nEach project you create should have it’s own directory which will be a folder with a descriptive file name. This root folder will contain a directory structure which allows you to organize your data and workflows. There’s no standardized format which this directory structure has to take, however there are some useful principles that will help you stay organized.\n\nProject Organization Principles\n\nUse subdirectories to stay organized. While R doesn’t care whether your project directory contains subdirectories, subdirectories are useful for keeping track of your files. As you build out increasingly complicated projects, you will likelly generate lots of data, metadata, scripts, and outputs. Subdirectories can help you to keep all of this information organized, and will make it easier for others to navigate your project.\nKeep raw and processed data separate. We want to set up workflows that allow us to consistently be able to transition from raw data to processed data, to outputs (that will end up in our outputs folder). If our project relied upon locally stored datasets, raw data should be placed in a separate folder for raw data. After it exists, raw data should only be read - it shouldn’t be written to. Depending upon the considerations of your workflow, you may want to create a separate folder for processed data - unlike your raw data folder, you may both read and write data to this folder.\nMaintain a local copy of data documentation. Whenever possible, download or include data documentation to go along with your raw data. This will be useful to refer to as you’re working, and will also help others who make work on the project in the future. As you modify data and create your own datasets, you should also consider creating documentation for your working data. Again, this will help you or others in the future.\nOutputs get their own subdirectory. Outputs may include tables, graphics, or any other output created by your analysis. Depending upon the quantity of outputs, you may choose to add additional subdirectories to your output folder to help organize your outputs.\nOrder your scripts. In addition to creating a dedicated subdirectory for your scripts, consider naming them in such a way that they are ordered and follow your data workflow. You may also want to develop a master script that sequentially runs your other scripts. You can use source() in this master script to run other scripts.\nQuarto Markdown gets its own subdirectory. Depending upon the complexity of your project, it may be useful to creata a directory for any Quarto Markdown documents you create.\n\nYour base project directory and structure will end up looking something like this:\nRoot\n |\n |_ data\n |   |_ data_raw\n |   |_ data_processed\n |\n |_ documentation\n |_ output\n |_ scripts\n |   |_ 01_master.r\n |   |_ 02_get_data.r\n |   |_ 03_plots.r\n |_ quarto\nAgain, there’s no standardized format which your directory structure has to take. Your structure may also change depending upon the specific considerations and workflows involved for a given project. Over time, you’ll develop a default folder structure that makes sense for how you tend to work.\n\nWhen we assess your work in UP 570, we will be looking for evidence that you are making effective use of project directory structures. Unless we state so, there’s no required directory structure format, however, we want to see you applying principles of good directory management in your work.\n\n\n\nProject Organization Workflows\nAfter we create our project directory and create a r project file, we can programmatically create our directory structure using the dir.create() command. For example:\n\n\nCode\n# Create project subdirectories\n\ndir.create(\"data\")\ndir.create(\"data/data_raw\")\ndir.create(\"data/data_processed\")\ndir.create(\"documentation\")\ndir.create(\"output\")\ndir.create(\"scripts\")\ndir.create(\"quarto\")\n\n\nWe could also save ourselves repetition in our code using the base R lapply() syntax. We create a list with our project directory names and assign that into an object. We then feel lapply() the list along with the function we wish to apply to each element of that list - in this case, dir.create():\n\n\nCode\n# Create project subdirectories\n\nproject_dirs <- c(\"data\", \"data/data_raw\", \"data/data_processed\", \"documentation\", \"output\", \"scripts\", \"quarto\")\n\nlapply(project_dirs, dir.create)\n\n\n\n\nScript Headers and Structure\nWhile a lot of our coding can be done directly in Quarto Markdown documents, you’ll also want to use scripts to store code and develop workflows that may eventually be represented as output in your Quarto document. Script headers can help to organize the work we do in scripts, and can help when we get ready to share our work with others or pick up work on files we have not looked at in a while.\nTaking a few extra minutes to develop a nice script header will be beneficial in the future - your future self, your collaborators, and others who use your code will appreciate it!\nLike so many other R things, there’s no standardized example of what a script header needs to include, howevver, here’s a basic header template to start with:\n\n\nCode\n# Title: [Insert script title here]\n# Author: [Your name]\n# Email: [Your email address]\n# Date: [Insert date here]\n\n# Script Name: [Script Name]\n\n# Description: [Insert a brief description of the script and its purpose]\n\n# Notes: [Insert any process notes or potential revision plans here]\n\n# Set up the working environment\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(library1)\nlibrary(library2)\n\n# Set global options\noptions(option1 = value1, option2 = value2)\n\n# Define functions\nfunction1 <- function(input1, input2) {\n  # function code goes here\n}\n\nfunction2 <- function(input1, input2) {\n  # function code goes here\n}\n\n# Main script\n\n# End of script\n\n\nThe different elements here help record who coded the script, what it is designed to do, and provides a common place to set options, load packages, and define functions. Although these components could occur anywhere in the script before they are called upon, includig them in the header helps track what’s going on in the script.\nWhile you could easily type out each element of your header every time that you develop a new script, you can also save your script as a code snippet within RStudio, which will allow you to easily insert the header template into new scripts you create.\n\n\nThis code snippet trick is paraphrased from the description provided by Dr. Timothy S. Farewell.\n\nIn RStudio, go to Tools -> Global Options -> Code -> Snippets -> Edit Snippets. This will bring up a block of code - scroll to the bottom.\nModify the below code header template to include your information and then copy / paste this into the snippets code block.\n\n\n\nCode\nsnippet header\n    # Title: \n    # Author:\n    # Email:\n    # Date:\n\n    # Script Name:\n\n    # Description:\n\n    # Notes:\n\n    # Working Environment Setup\n\n    # Load required libraries\n    load_packages <- c(\"tidyverse\", \"sf\") # Add more packages here as needed\n    lapply(load_packages, library, character.only = TRUE)\n\n    # Set global options\n\n    # Define functions\n\n\n 3. Save and close the window.\nYou have now added this snippet to your library. When you start a new script, simply type “header” and press tab and RStudio will fill in your header template.\n\n\nSnippets are handy - you may soon identify other common bits of code that you use frequently that you want to make snippets out of.\n\n\nNaming Files\nAs mentioned in the Project Organization Principles section, it’s important to spend a little time thinking about conventions for your filenames. Some useful principles:\n\nAvoid using special characters (for instance, \\ / : * ? ” < > |) in file names.\nDo not use spaces in filenames. You may use an underscore (e.g. map_census_tracts.png) to help with readability.\nIf you choose to use dates as part of your filename, order them yyy-mm-dd (e.g. 20230102 would be January 2, 2023). If you have multiple versions of the file from different dates, this ensures that your files will be properly ordered by the date.\n\n\n\nThis date format (yyy-mm-dd) conforms to ISO 8601 format.\n\nWhen creating ordered lists for file names (ordered by number) use at least two digits (e.g. “01_Main”, “02_Download”, “03_Map”). This will keep your files in order once you get past 10."

    "section": "Workflow 2: Working in Quarto",
    "text": "Workflow 2: Working in Quarto\nQuarto is a tool built into RStudio which allows you to create a variety of documents that can integrate plain text and code. It’s utility comes both in it’s ability to translate plain text into a variety of well-formatted outputs, but also due to the ease with which we can use this format to share code, analysis, and writing with others. Most of your written assignments in class will be produced in Quarto, therefore, you’ll want to become familiar with the basic syntax and logic.\nQuarto’s plain text formatting is handled using Markdown syntax which is designed to be simple, easily interpreted as text with formatting in place, and readable on most computers. An increasing number of note systems and word processors have adopted Markdown as their language.\n\n\nSome examples include Bear, Obsidian, Notion, Ulysses. Mentions are not endorsements.\n\nFormatting Your Documents\nQuarto makes use of a modified version of Markdown syntax. The Quarto website maintains excellent documentation regarding basic markdown formatting options as well as Quarto-specific formatting options:\n\nYou should familiarize yourself with how to format text, how to use section headings, and how to link files and insert references to other files.\n\n\nAdding References\nQuarto can help you either manage references in very sinple ways or more complex ways. You can either add references directly to your text as either footnotes or endnotes.\n\nFootnotes\nWe oftentimes use footnotes as an easy way to convey references or links to details or important information that does not need to be in our main body of text. Quarto allows you to create both footnotes and long notes. Footnotes are typically short and take up only a line or two. Long notes are longer and may contain multiple paragraphs.\n  \nHere is some text with a footnote.[^1]\n\n[^1]: And here is the footnote that accompanies that text in the footnotes section.\n\nHere is also some text with an inline footnote.^[Here is the text associated with the inline footnote - this may be easier to track because it is in line with the text.]\n\nHere is some text with a longnote.[^longnote]\n\n[^longnote]: And here is a longnote that takes up multiple lines. You can experiment in your text to see whether a footnote or longnote will serve you better for a given situation.\n  \n  This text is also part of the long note - the indent signals that it remains part of the note.\n  \nAnd this text would be part of the next paragraph that's outside of the note because it is not indented.\nHere is some text with a footnote1\nHere is also some text with an inline footnote.2\nHere is some text with a longnote3\nAnd this text would be part of the next paragraph that’s outside of the note because it is not indented.\n\n\nAsides\nYou can also add asides to documents which places a note in line with text in the margin.\n\n\nFor a very effective example of asides, see Kieran Healy’s book Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.\n:::{.aside}\nHere is an aside placed in line with text in the margin.\n:::\n\n\nHere is an aside placed in line with text in the margin.\n\n\nCitations and Bibliographies\nFor longer or more advanced documents, you may wish to rely upon Quarto’s suppot for using and managing references with BibTex, a standard reference format. This allows you to add references to your document and then create in line citations and a formatted bibliography to accompany your writing.\nIn order to create a bibliography that is associated with a document, you’ll need three files:\n\nA main file written in Quarto Markdown (.qmd). This file will be formatted to include citation references.\nA bibliographic data source, typically a Bibtex (.bibtex) file.\nA csl file - this specifies the format for your bibliography. You can find and include different csl files to produce a bibliography using different reference styles.\n\n\nStep 1: Create a bibliography file.\nUsing a text editor, create a plain text file that will contain your bibliographic references. In this case, we’ll create a text file called “references.bib”. Note that this file should end in .bib to signify that it is a bibliographic reference file.\n\n\nStep 2: Refer to the bibliography file in your YAML Header\nNext, in your Quarto Markdown document, you’ll add a line to your YAML header that refers to the location and name of your bibliography file.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define a citation style\nLike most other reference management systems, you can define what reference syle your references will be rendered as, and change this as needed. The Citation Style Language (CSL) project defines a common language and structure for styles. These are stored in .csl files which you will associate with your document. You can find and download .csl files in a range of formats from the CSL Project’s repository.\n\n\nYou can also find and download csl files in Zotero’s style repository. If you hover over a style format, it provides examples of what a citation will look like in your redered document.\nFor the sake of example, we’ll format our document using American Psychological Association (APA) format. We’ll search the CSL Project’s repository to find an appropriate APA style .csl file. Once you find the appropriate file, then download the file and place it in the same directory as our .bib file.\n Click on the .csl style format you want to use. You’ll then be taken to a page that includes the specific file’s contents.\n\nFrom here, you can right click on the button that says “raw” and download the .csl file.\n Note that before you move this file from your download folder to the folder where your .bib file is located, you may need to alter the file extension to indicate that this is a .csl file. Once you have done this, move it to the folder where your .bib file is located and then add a csl reference to your YAML header.\n\n\nCode\n---\ntitle: \"Neighborhood Analysis: Place Selection Memorandum\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: apa-6th-edition.csl\n---\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Add references to your document\nYou’re now set up to add references to your document. You can add references in lots of different ways. If you’re searching for references using a service like Google Scholar, under the “cite” options for a given reference, you’ll see a URL to download the BibTeX citation associated with that reference.\n Click on BibTeX and the citation contents will show:\n\nCopy this text, and paste it into your bibliographic reference file (in our example, references.bib).\n\nYou can then cite this reference while you write by referring to it as follows:\n\n\nCode\n[@healy2018data] provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\n\n\n(Healy, 2018) provides useful examples for leveraging GGPlot to create data visualization.\nNote that the actual reference corresponds to the first clause in the bibtex reference.\n\n\nYou can change the reference name if you’d like to something you’ll remember as you cite.\nYou can paste more references into the same references.bib file and cite them as well.\n\n\nYou can find more details on formatting citations on the Quarto website.\nOnline tools like Citation Machine can help you to build references for a range of online sources. (Feder, n.d.) takes a little while to get used to, but these tools can help you to build out an effective citation workflow.\n\n\nStep 5: Place your bibliography\nQuarto will automatically place your references at the end of your document (or wherever your style definition file calls for references to be placed). You can also explicitly tell Quarto where to place your references by creating a div as follows:\n\n\nCode\n\n## References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\nYou should end up with a formatted reference section at the end of your document.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Considerations\nIt’s ultimately up to you how you manage and generate references within your documents. If you have a document with very few references, footnotes and/or endnotes may be an appropriate strategy. A more complex document with many references may be better managed using BibTeX. You can also use another reference management system and then export citations in BibTeX format which can then be added to your Quarto Markdown document."

    "text": "This lab focuses on getting your computer set up to communicate with Github and to introduce several workflows for publicly sharing your work. We will use these workflows throughout the course to share work and record feedback. Github represents a standard industry tool for code version control, collaborative development, debugging, and documentation.\nWhile code version control isn’t directly a focal point within practices of neighborhood analysis, we leverage it as a strategy to achieve one of our course goals. As we have discussed in our introductory framing to the course, transparency is an important principle of accountability within data analysis. Version control systems allow us to track changes in our code over time. These systems can help to facilitate accountability by making code accessible and easy to share. Version control systems also opens up the opportunities for collaboration, especially around the debugging of code.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those people who have not used these systems before, there’s some core concepts to master. Once you do, integrating these systems into your workflow will become much easier. By the end of the class, you will have a lot of experience leveraging these tools as part of your workflows.\nVersion control systems like Github are also well integrated with several other tools that make it really easy to quickly and effectively share analysis via the internet. Again, this form of sharing is not integral to neighborhood analysis, but it does help us achieve a course goal focused on accessibility of analysis. While print and paper documents still rightfully have their place in our workflows, increasingly, our work is shared and consumed digitally. Being able to produce documents that are publicly accessible via the internet, therefore, becomes an important workflow for us to master.\n\n\nPlease read this lab background in its entirety before you proceed to engage the lab prompts."

    "section": "Configure Your Computer to Talk to Github",
    "text": "Configure Your Computer to Talk to Github\nOur first task is to configure your computer to talk to Github. This assumes that you already have a Github account set up, but that you have not linked this account to your local computer. A great resource that takes you step by step through Github workflows is Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. The recommended configuration below paraphrases the options found on that site.\nLet’s get started!\n\nRegister a Github Account\nGithub is an implementation of Git, which is a version control system designed to help you keep track of files (especially code) which are likely to be updated often. GitHub has some features similar to Dropbox or Box, but with far more emphasis on versioning your work and tracking changes. Within our class, we’ll use GitHub as a location where you’ll store work outputs which you will receive feedback.\n\n\nLet’s get this set up:\n\nIf you do not already have a GitHub account, go to GitHub.com and then click on Sign Up to create a new account. You will make a username (see some sage username advice here), enter your email address, and password, and then hit create account. I recommend using your UIUC email address for this step if you’re creating a new account (for my rationale, see the next step).\nGitHub offers some services for free which you can access with your basic account, however, as a student at an educational institution, you can register with GitHub for Education to receive enhanced benefits and services. You will be asked to verify your association with an academic institution, which you can do by entering your [netid](illinois.edu?) email address and taking a picture of your I-Card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Your Local Machine to Talk to GitHub\nYou can upload files directly to a GitHub repository in the GitHub web interface, but as you create more complex files and file structures, that’s not going to be a feasible way to manage your work. That strategy also overlooks most of the features of what GitHub is at its core - a version control system.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might want to version our work for several reasons:\n\nTo keep track of changes we’ve made, so that we can track when code works and when we’ve broken it\nTo be able to share code with collaborators and work on the same files at the same time and then reconcile and combine work all together\nTo be able to share code and data publicly with others\n\nAll three of these rationales are important motivations within the context of our class. There are two strategies which you may want to try to integrate GitHub into your R workflow.\nRStudio has GitHub functionality built right in, which is very handy for integrating version control into your R workflow. Assuming you’ve already got R and RStudio installed on your system and have already set up a GitHub account, start here:\n\nCheck to see if Git is installed on your computer, and if it isnt, Install Git.\nAssociate git on your computer with your GitHub account.\nInstall a Git client like GitHub Desktop.\nConnect to GitHub\nConnect RStudio to GitHub\nGet Started using GitHub integrated with R. This video shows you how to communicate with your Github repository using RStudio:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will ease our way into using Github, and will also devote some time to troubleshooting in class. I promise, it’s going to make sense soon!"

We’ll also learn another more involved strategy which you may choose to employ. This involves pushing published code and HTML content that represents a publishable document or website to Github and then linking this repository to a web hosting service like Netlify which will then publish the site for you.\nThis strategy can be useful in that you end up with two deliverables - your code base and associated HTML files on GitHub and a website hosted by Netlify. Our course website - the very website you are reading right now - is published using this pipeline. The webpages are each a Quarto Markdown file. The files are pushed to a Github repository. Netlify links to this repository and when new updates are pushed to Github, Netlify “refreshes” the website, typically within a minute or less of the push being complete.\nIf you simply want a quick and easy way to share your work, Quarto Pub may be completely sufficient! If you want more advanced web hosting options and configurability (like domain management), Netlify may be a more appropriate solution. We will learn both strategies, and you should take the time to become comfortable using either strategy.\n\nWhat is Netlify?\nNetlify is a web development platform that automates the building a serving of websites. While certain aspects of the Netlify platform are monetized, the types of basic elements which we can use to create and serve a website are available for free.\nWhen we grant Netlify access to a GitHub repository, it looks for files that can be rendered as html and then serves those at a unique URL. When we commit and push updates to that repository, Netlify updates the files that are being served to the internet.\nQuarto Markdown can produce outputs in a variety of formats including html. Netlify is built around looking for html files in our GitHub repository. Typically, when we render Quarto Markdown as HTML locally, it will create a _site file in our root folder. That folder has all of the content that we want Netlify to serve on the internet.\nWith these things in mind, let’s try getting our lab files on Netlify!"

    "text": "Communicating with GitHub from Rstudio.\nAlthough this lab is formally introducing GitHub’s functionality as part of our class, you have already gotten some experience interacting manually with GitHub as you needed to download a repository in order to complete your first lab. From here on out, you can use RStudio to communicate directly with GitHub so that pushing and pulling repositories can all happen within your RStudio session. By the end of this lab, you will have gained some experience pushing and pulling files (specifically your lab files). From here on out in class, we will assume that you will use GitHub to submit your code for review. Instructions will be clearly posted with both lab and homework assignments.\nWith those things in mind, let’s think about how we communicate with Github from RStudio.\n\nBasic Workflows\nAs you have read on the Happy with GitR site, GitHub’s utility comes from allowing us to store remote versions of our code which others can then access, comment on, and modify. GitHub allows us to track versions of our code, and if we need to, we can revert to earlier versions, or fork branches - make special versions of our code which we may want to experiment with or modify. We can also reconcile multiple versions of code back into a single main version, which is particularly useful when we are collaboratively writing or editing code.\nFor the most part, our course focuses on building a workflow involving a single code author, and not on building collaborative workflows, although you should try collaborating with each other on modifying code. Our end goal in this class is to develop workflows for transparency, accountability, and accessibility.\n\n\nReviewing Common Operations\n\n\n\nImage by Allison Horst from https://allisonhorst.com\n\n\n\nLocal vs. Remote\nLocal vs Remote: Let’s start with the basic distinction between local and remote versions of our work. Local versions are contained on the hard drive of the computer we are working on. Remote versions are in the cloud, in this case, on GitHub’s servers. We will typically work on editing data locally, and will then push our modifications to be integrated into the remote version.\n\n\nPush vs. Pull\nPush vs Pull: To understand this, it’s useful to think about what’s happening from the perspective of your local computer. We pull a version of the repository from the remote repository to our local computer. We push a version of the repository from our local computer to the remote repository.\n\n\nCommit\nCommit: As we make changes to our local repository, GitHub is comparing these changes to the prior version of our repository. When we commit changes, we are essentially asking GitHub to create a markerpost that we could return to in the future. We even label our commits with a brief descriptive note so we can remember what that marker represents. Note that when you commit changes locally, they are not automatically pushed to your remote repository - you have to do that as an extra step. You can, for instance, make multiple local commits to a local repository and then push them to your remote repository.\nCommits help to keep us organized. While your commits do not have to be linear or follow any particular order within your data and analysis workflow, they can help you track contributions to what has been done.\n\n\n\nImage by Allison Horst from https://allisonhorst.com\n\n\nCommits serve as failsafe points - we can always revert or rewind our code to where we made commits if we need to debug or if something goes wrong. \n\n\n\nCommon Operations\nSo how do we put these pieces together?\n\nIf we already have a remote repository with code or a file structure in it, we create a connection to that remote repository and create a local repository by pulling it from GitHub.\nWe then make changes to the repository - this might be in RStudio, or we might add, move, or delete things manually.\nWhen we get to a point where we want to create a failsafe point in our code, we commit the changes we made (and add a plain text description of what our commit contains).\nWe push our commit to our remote version where it will become to version of record (GitHub is tracking the changes we made, so if we need to revert to our previous commit, we could).\nJust to be safe, after we push our commits, we may want to pull from the remote server again just to confirm that the version on our local machine is up to date.\n\nFrom there, we can continue making changes until we are ready to make another commit.\n\n\n\nImage by Allison Horst from https://allisonhorst.com\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow - Setting up a Local Repository from an Existing GitHub Repository\nFor interaction with our labs (which are already generated repositories on GitHub), you’ll want to follow the instructions for “Existing Project, GitHub First” on the Happy with Git and GitHub for the useR site. The site presents multiple ways to do this. I suggest starting with 16.2.2 where the instructions walk through using the RStudioIDE to connect to an existing remote GitHub repository.\nFor all UP 570 labs and assignments, existing repositories are provided for you (when you click the lab URL to accept the repository, a user-specific version is created for you from a master copy stored on GitHub). You can then connect to this repository in RStudio, create a local copy on your computer, modify that local repository by making changes, adding data and writing, as well as proejct documentation. You can then stage the changes you’ve made, commit your changes locally, and push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub."

    "text": "Basic Communication Strategies\n\nMemo Format\nMemos are often used by urban planners to share information within their agency or with other planners and local government officials. Memos tend to be concise documents that may contain either requested information for staff or recommendations on how to debate or take action around a particular policy issue. Memos are built around clear and concise writing with a logical structure, clear illustrations and visualizations, proper formatting and spelling.\nMemos start with a heading that includes the name of the memo author, name of the intended recipient, date, and a descriptive subject heading:\nMemorandum\n\nTo: Janet Jacobs, Planning Director\nFrom: Mae Q. Plannington, Planner 1\nDate: October 7, 2022\nSubject: Recommendation on Zoning Change for Holloway Parcel\nA memo is typically written in response to something. The first paragraph of the memo should describe what the memo is responding to, and should summarize what the writer of the memo has done to prepare the response. The first paragraph should also summarize any key findings or recommendations.\nInformation within a memo should be organized in a logical fashion. Section headings with descriptive titles help your audience find particular information more easily.\nGeneral information should be presented first followed by more detailed information. As you support information with evidence, you should follow the same progression of general to specific.\nMemos should conclude with a summary statement that encapsulates the key findings which you have come up with. If you are providing recommendations in your memo, this is also an appropriate place to re-state your recommendations, and provide instructions for how your memo recipient should follow up.\nBecause a memo is designed to be a concise document, you may have important additional information which would be useful to share, but which does not fit within the scope of the memorandum. Such items can be included in an appendix or attachment to the memo, and should be referenced as appropriate within the memo (e.g. “See the attached document for the property surveyor’s description of the Holloway parcel”).\n\n\nShort Report Format\nPresent your analysis in the format of a short report or “data brief.”\n\n\nDo Not Include Title Page\nTitle pages have their place in academic papers and larger, formal technical reports. However, they are inappropriate for memos and short data or policy briefs. Keep it simple.\n\n\nAvoid Headers and Footers in Memos\nRunning footers and headers also have their place for certain types of documents, but not for memos.\n\n\nNo Conclusion Needed\nIn other contexts, you have likely been taught to include both introductions and conclusions as ways to help transition in and out of different sections. The memo format is more direct, and does not require the use of opening and closing paragraphs. State you case and let it go at that.\n\n\nNotes and Citations\n\nUse Notes for Technical Explanations\nFootnotes or endnotes are best for stating brief technical explanations for methods and data. Reports may require a longer methodological appendix, but this is typically not appropriate for a memorandum.\n\n\nUse Notes for Citations\nUse an endnote or footnote to cite sources for memos and report briefs. Bibliographies or “Works Cited” lists are appropriate for longer reports or academic papers.\n\n\nCombine Data Source Citations\nIt makes good sense to use endnotes or footnotes to discuss data used in an analysis in a memo or report brief. But you do not necessarily need to use a separate note for each data source or series. Instead, combine them by introducing one note early in the document. Something like: “The data used in this analysis are from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 5-year American Community Survey and 2020 Census Household Pulse Survey”.\n\n\n\nFormatting Considerations for Printing\nIncreasingly, memos and other routine planning communications are communicated digitally, however, it is important to prepare documents that will be legible when printed. In most circumstances, formatting considerations for printing will also apply to documents intended to be communicated digitally.\n\nLeft Justify Text\nUse left justification for text, and not full justification.\n\n\nInclude Page Numbers\nInclude page numbers in the bottom center or bottom right of your page.\n\n\nOne Inch Margins\nUse one inch margins on the left, right, top and bottom, including on all pages with tables and figures.\n\n\nTwelve point font\nUse a twelve point font, preferably something like Times for your text. You can use a ten point font for footnotes and endnotes. No text should be smaller than ten points."

    "title": "Communicating Quantitative Information",
    "section": "Style",
    "text": "Style\n\nAwkward Sentence Construction\nA catch-all category for a painful-to-read but not necessarily grammatically incorrect sentence. Sentence may be an affront to good writing style. Admittedly, professors often put AWK in places where they know something is amiss, but not being writing instructors, they’re not sure technically how to explain what is wrong. Bottom line: the sentence doesn’t work. Proofread yourself and then have someone else read to ensure clarity.\n\n\nWrite Directly\nDon’t mince words: come out and say it. Instead of “The BLS and BEA data show that employment in the microchip industry is very small,” write “Employment in the microchip industry is very small.” Or, instead of “It is very important to note that data disclosure rules preclude reporting employment for all sectors,” write “Data disclosure rules preclude. . .”\n\n\nAvoid Excessive Use of Jargon\nAvoid the planner’s pitfall: too much use of all those fancy planning terms and acronyms. It’s not impressive or erudite, just boring.\n\n\nAvoid Passive Voice\nThe extensive use of passive voice may be the single most common reason why a majority of sane individuals would rather walk on hot coals than read a technical document. Doesn’t “The region’s population growth dramatically outpaced the nation’s over the study period” sound better than “Using population data, it was found that the region grew much faster than the US over the study period”?\nAnother example: replace “A three-part analysis will be conducted in this paper” with “This paper will present a three-part analysis” or “In this paper, I will conduct a three-part analysis.” Reject passivity. Be active.\n\n\nUse Active Headings and Subheadings\nUse headings and subheadings to help organize your findings and discussion. In addition, keep ’em active and efficient. Instead of “Location Quotient Analysis” as a sub-heading, try a short title that conveys findings, e.g., “Region Specialized in Manufacturing and Services.” Headings and subheadings should never extend beyond one line of text.\n\n\nAvoid Unnecessary Equivocation\nSometimes it makes sense to offer caveats or otherwise “hedge your bets” when discussing a finding. However, don’t overdo it. Population growth doesn’t “seem fast.” It either is or is not fast, relative to something else (which you should be comparing it to). A location quotient indicates whether a region is or is not specialized in a given industry; it does not indicate that the region “seems specialized” or “may be specialized.” On the other hand, location quotients do not say much beyond specialization (you would not damn the torpedoes and argue, on the basis of a manufacturing LQ above 1.2, that the region is “highly competitive” in manufacturing).\nIf you find yourself making equivocations, it’s worthwhile to revisit the evidence you’ve provided to make a point to ensure you’re making the strongest argument possible. Communicate that argument confidently, and provide appropriate caveats when necessary.\n\n\nIn Memos, Don’t Stay What You’re Going to Say\nIn academic papers or longer reports it often makes sense to provide a roadmap to the document (e.g., “This report begins by summarizing major trends in population. It then. . .”). The adage that you should “say what you are going to say, say it, then say what you said” doesn’t apply for short policy and analysis pieces. Just get on with the analysis and findings. Strong organization and active headings will help your reader infer how you’ll make your points.\n\n\nPlaces Don’t Have Agency\nIn discussing social, economic, and demographic trends for neighborhoods, cities and regions, avoid implying that places have “agency.” Example:\nEl Paso shifted its population mix in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nIn this case, El Paso as a collective, is being treated as an actor when it is actually simply a place with a collection of actors (people, households, businesses, organizations) who are reacting to the federal policy change in various ways.\nIt would be more accurate to say something like this:\nEl Paso’s population mix shifted in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nThere may be cases when implying the place is an actor makes sense, for instance when you are discussing a community-wide strategy or policy.\n\n\nDiscuss Findings, Not Exhibits\nPeople don’t want to read about figures and tables. They want to read about trends that matter from your analysis. Avoid discussing exhibits. Instead, discuss findings, referring to figures and tables as supporting evidence.\nNo: “Figure 1 shows that poverty in center city neighborhoods in Cleveland is increasing.”\nYes: “Poverty in center city Cleveland is increasing (see Table 1).”"

    "section": "Usage",
    "text": "Usage\n\nPrint and Proof\nWe increasingly have an imperative to produce, edit, and disseminate our work using a completely electronic workflow. This has its benefits, but you need to develop a workflow that allows you to edit your draft with diligence. Printing and proofing a document by hand can often catch errors that would otherwise become lost in digital copy - such mistakes often reveal themselves in embarrassingly stark relief once disseminated.\n\n\nDefine Acronyms on First Use\nThe first time you use an acronym (e.g., HUD), spell it out, followed by the acronym in parentheses. “Data are from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).” Then use the acronym to your heart’s content.\n\n\nWrite out Numbers Less than 11\nAlthough sometimes the convention is that numbers one through ninety-nine should be spelled out. Numerals should be used for rates, percentages and other “data” indicators. Thus we would write “there are eight counties in the MSA,” but “the region grew by 8 percent.”\n\n\nSpell out Numbers Starting Sentences\nAny number that begins a sentence (or a bullet point) should be spelled out.\n\n\nWatch Your Capitalization\nNo need to capitalize industries, occupations, or other sectoral-type categories. Do not over-capitalize. Note that when referring to a single county, write “Tehama County.” But writing about multiple counties, it is “Tehama and Shasta counties.” Also: the “City of New York” but the “cities of Palo Alto and San Jose.”\n\n\nNo Apostrophe on Dates\nWhen referring to decades (e.g., 1990s), do not use an apostrophe.\n\n\nData are Plural\nNo: “The data is hard to find.”\nYes: “The data are hard to find.”\n\n\nUse Proper Note Punctuation\nNote numbers are best placed at the end of a sentence outside the punctuation.\nYes: This is a sentence that requires a citation.1\nNo: This is a sentence that requires a citation2.\n\n\nComplete Sentences in Notes\nFootnotes and endnotes should be complete sentences. Complete sentences have punctuation at the end.\n\n\nPunctuation Inside Quotes\nPunctuation generally goes inside quotes.\nYes: “Run, Tom, run,” said Jane.\nNo: “Down, Spot, down”, said Percival, Dick’s little-known cousin from Topeka.\n\n\nWrite out Percent\nOne of the few times the “less ink is better” rule is violated. Write “8 percent,” not “8%.” It’s less distracting to the eye.\n\n\nUse Arabic Numbers for Notes\nMicrosoft Word often defaults to the use of Roman numerals for notes and endnotes (i, ii, iii. . .). Change this option and use Arabic numerals. More efficient.\n\n\nCiting the URL is Not Enough\nIn the Internet age it has become distressingly common practice to cite only the URL for online documents. But consider this: if you quoted Tolstoy’s War and Peace using a copy you checked out from the New York Public Library, you would not cite the library as the source. The same principle applies to the Internet. For web sites, which are inherently Internet-based, you should list the name of the cite and then the URL. For documents accessed online, you should cite in the usual way (author, date, title, etc.) and then include the URL. Note that you are not obligated to list the URL for freestanding documents if you include the complete citation otherwise.\n\n\nAvoid Ampersand (&) in Text\nThe symbol “&”, known as the ampersand, should not be used in your text write-up. It is ok to use it for labels in tables and figures."

    "section": "Numbers",
    "text": "Numbers\n\nInterpret Quantities by Comparison\nDo not just report growth rates, quantities and other indicators for individual places. They are hard to interpret by themselves. For example, to back up a claim that your region has faced substantial population growth in the last decade, contrast its growth rate with the national average growth rate.\n\n\nExplain Regional Geography\nThe first time you mention your region, explain–either in the text or in a note–what its geographic composition is (e.g., its counties).\n\n\nSignificant Digits\nUse numbers with levels of precision that match the realistic precision in the underlying data. Should a location quotient be expressed as 1.709? No. Round to the nearest tenth (1.7). Percentage growth rates for subnational areas are also usually best expressed with one decimal place. Shares can be converted to percentages and expressed to one decimal place to make them more readable.\n\n\nOnly Include Exhibits You Reference in Text\nNo table, figure, chart or line drawing should be included in the report or report appendix unless it is referenced somewhere in the text discussion. That reference may be very brief (“see Table 4”), but it has to be there (it could also be in an endnote or footnote). Think of it this way: if it wasn’t important enough for you to mention it, why did you include it?\n\n\nReport the Quantity\nSometimes it is easy to forget to report the variable levels when we are analyzing variable trends. For example, it is common in analyses of wage trends (“wages are on the up and up”) to find nary a mention of wage levels. As a reader, you are left wondering “wages are going up, but are they high or low?” It is better to ground an analysis of changes in a given variable with a mention of the levels of the variable. So “The current annual average wage in River City for production workers is $27,500. That is up 12 percent in real terms since 1997. By contrast, the average production worker wage nationwide increased by 16.5 percent. . .”\n\n\nEmphasize Significant Findings\nWhen analyzing data we are looking for the most significant findings and often a “story” that helps explain those findings. In descriptive analysis, significance is often first assessed not in a statistical sense, but by looking for high and low values or major changes. But not all high/low values or large changes are necessarily important from a policy or planning point of view. Be careful to think through the potential implications of a finding before discussing it. Ask yourself: “So what?” If you can’t think of an answer, leave it out. (Example: “Since 1990, River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in every quarter except IIQ 1996 and IVQ 1998” might be better stated as “River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in 54 of the last 56 quarters.” A subtle change but the reader is not left asking: “Hmm, I wonder if I’m supposed to know why it was higher in those two periods?”\n\n\nPercent versus Percentage Points\nLet’s say you’re comparing the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.0 percent to the Peoria unemployment rate of 4.0 percent. Is the Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national rate? No. It is 1 percentage point lower. A Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national average would be 4.95 percent.\n\n\nRefer to Exhibits in Text\nRefer to your figures and tables directly in your text. Example: “Table 2 reports employment growth figures for the 1995 to 2003 period.” Or: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (see Table 4).” If you are going to send readers to a table in a parenthetical phrase (like the last example), be sure to include the word “see.” So, you would not write: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (Table 4).”"

    "text": "Tables, Figures and Graphics\n\nMake ’Em so they Stand Alone\nFigures, graphs and tables should be constructed so that they can stand alone (as much as feasible). That is, someone could pick up and read the table without the accompanying text and get the gist of what it is trying to say. It goes without saying that sources of all data and calculations should be clearly indicated.\n\n\nAvoid Use of Grids in Tables\nThere is almost never any reason to include gridlines on a data table. Putting a line below the column headings and one below the last row of data, followed by the data source, is usually the best approach.\n\n\nDecimal Justify Data Columns\nLine up columns of numbers in tables on their explicit or implicit decimal points. Do not center justify numeric data.\n\n\nUse Descriptive Column Labels in Tables\nRemember the golden rule in table and figure construction: make it stand alone. That means column headings that someone can understand without reading the report body. Sometimes this is hard to do efficiently (headings can get too long). In such cases an alternative is to use short-hand headings but explain what they mean in a footnote to the table.\n\n\nUse Label Hierarchies in Tables\nA good way to make tables more efficient is to use hierarchical labeling of columns. In the table below, employment and payroll data for Illinois were available in 2003. But national and regional data were available only for 2001. The table efficiently reports the 2003 Illinois numbers along with national and Midwest growth rates for 1990-2001 and location quotients for 2001. A note at the bottom of the table should clarify how the Midwest is defined as well as what the reference area is for the location quotient.\n\n\n\nIndicate Source on Figures and Tables\nData sources should be indicated clearly on all figures and tables.\n\n\nUse Detailed Sources\nFor some series simply listing the data provider agency is not enough. For example, BLS reports several employment series. Therefore, list the series within BLS (or other) that you are using. For example, Regional Economic Information System, US Bureau of Economic Analysis, or Covered Wages and Employment, US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\nPie Chart? No Thanks\nWhile seductive to the eye, pie charts are far less interpretable than a simple bar chart. Go for conveying your findings clearly, not spicing up your document with spurious graphical devices.\n\n\nShun 3-D\nThree dimensional bar charts and other graphics generally should be avoided. They usually compromise proper interpretation of the findings. Keep it simple: no 3-D.\n\n\nCall Tables “Tables” and Figures “Figures”\nBy convention, tables are called “tables” and graphics such as data charts or line drawings are called “figures.” Sometimes people use the word “exhibit” to label a line drawing. Avoid use of the terms “chart” and “graphic” for labels (e.g., Chart 1, Graphic 1). Also, never call a table a figure or a figure a table. Note that exhibit labels are generally capitalized: “Population trends for River City are summarized in Table 4.”\n\n\nSequence Tables and Figures in Order in the Text\nIf you have three tables, do not discuss Table 1, then Table 3, then Table 2. If the results in Table 3 are mentioned prior to those in Table 2, renumber the tables. Same for figures or any other exhibit.\n\n\nUse Commas for Numbers\nIn data tables, include commas in the number formatting to denote significant digits. So: $47,500 instead of $47500.\n\n\nAvoid Grids on Figures\nMany graphical packages default settings include gridlines on charts. Most charts are simple enough not to need them to be clearly interpreted. Get rid of the clutter and save some ink!\n\n\nDon’t Rely on Color\nRemember that your best intents for people to view your document in color may be foiled - some individuals may print documents in grayscale, and others may be colorblind and unable to perceive all colors. That means your document should not depend on color to convey its findings. An example of depending on color would be to use red text in your tables to indicate negative values or any color to highlight interesting trends.\n\n\nReport Numbers in 000s\nIt is ok to report very large numbers in thousands or even millions in tables if the precision in the original units is unnecessary. It is probably not critical in most cases for people to know that the US population changed by 1,456,789 over a given period (1.46 million will probably suffice). For small areas, such as counties and regions, reporting the original units is usually preferred except for large number variables (e.g., total dollar income).\n\n\nNo Superfluous Material\nAvoid the practice of tacking on government documents or tables to your reports as “general points of information.” The idea in most professional writing is to convey maximum information with minimum material; tossing in nonessential material from secondary sources defeats that aim."

In most circumstances, formatting considerations for printing will also apply to documents intended to be communicated digitally.\n\nLeft Justify Text\nUse left justification for text, and not full justification.\n\n\nInclude Page Numbers\nInclude page numbers in the bottom center or bottom right of your page.\n\n\nOne Inch Margins\nUse one inch margins on the left, right, top and bottom, including on all pages with tables and figures.\n\n\nTwelve point font\nUse a twelve point font, preferably something like Times for your text. You can use a ten point font for footnotes and endnotes. No text should be smaller than ten points."

    "section": "Style",
    "text": "Style\n\nAwkward Sentence Construction\nA catch-all category for a painful-to-read but not necessarily grammatically incorrect sentence. Sentence may be an affront to good writing style. Admittedly, professors often put AWK in places where they know something is amiss, but not being writing instructors, they’re not sure technically how to explain what is wrong. Bottom line: the sentence doesn’t work. Proofread yourself and then have someone else read to ensure clarity.\n\n\nWrite Directly\nDon’t mince words: come out and say it. Instead of “The BLS and BEA data show that employment in the microchip industry is very small,” write “Employment in the microchip industry is very small.” Or, instead of “It is very important to note that data disclosure rules preclude reporting employment for all sectors,” write “Data disclosure rules preclude. . .”\n\n\nAvoid Excessive Use of Jargon\nAvoid the planner’s pitfall: too much use of all those fancy planning terms and acronyms. It’s not impressive or erudite, just boring.\n\n\nAvoid Passive Voice\nThe extensive use of passive voice may be the single most common reason why a majority of sane individuals would rather walk on hot coals than read a technical document. Doesn’t “The region’s population growth dramatically outpaced the nation’s over the study period” sound better than “Using population data, it was found that the region grew much faster than the US over the study period”?\nAnother example: replace “A three-part analysis will be conducted in this paper” with “This paper will present a three-part analysis” or “In this paper, I will conduct a three-part analysis.” Reject passivity. Be active.\n\n\nUse Active Headings and Subheadings\nUse headings and subheadings to help organize your findings and discussion. In addition, keep ’em active and efficient. Instead of “Location Quotient Analysis” as a sub-heading, try a short title that conveys findings, e.g., “Region Specialized in Manufacturing and Services.” Headings and subheadings should never extend beyond one line of text.\n\n\nAvoid Unnecessary Equivocation\nSometimes it makes sense to offer caveats or otherwise “hedge your bets” when discussing a finding. However, don’t overdo it. Population growth doesn’t “seem fast.” It either is or is not fast, relative to something else (which you should be comparing it to). A location quotient indicates whether a region is or is not specialized in a given industry; it does not indicate that the region “seems specialized” or “may be specialized.” On the other hand, location quotients do not say much beyond specialization (you would not damn the torpedoes and argue, on the basis of a manufacturing LQ above 1.2, that the region is “highly competitive” in manufacturing).\nIf you find yourself making equivocations, it’s worthwhile to revisit the evidence you’ve provided to make a point to ensure you’re making the strongest argument possible. Communicate that argument confidently, and provide appropriate caveats when necessary.\n\n\nIn Memos, Don’t Stay What You’re Going to Say\nIn academic papers or longer reports it often makes sense to provide a roadmap to the document (e.g., “This report begins by summarizing major trends in population. It then. . .”). The adage that you should “say what you are going to say, say it, then say what you said” doesn’t apply for short policy and analysis pieces. Just get on with the analysis and findings. Strong organization and active headings will help your reader infer how you’ll make your points.\n\n\nPlaces Don’t Have Agency\nIn discussing social, economic, and demographic trends for neighborhoods, cities and regions, avoid implying that places have “agency.” Example:\nEl Paso shifted its population mix in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nIn this case, El Paso as a collective, is being treated as an actor when it is actually simply a place with a collection of actors (people, households, businesses, organizations) who are reacting to the federal policy change in various ways.\nIt would be more accurate to say something like this:\nEl Paso’s population mix shifted in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.\nThere may be cases when implying the place is an actor makes sense, for instance when you are discussing a community-wide strategy or policy.\n\n\nDiscuss Findings, Not Exhibits\nPeople don’t want to read about figures and tables. They want to read about trends that matter from your analysis. Avoid discussing exhibits. Instead, discuss findings, referring to figures and tables as supporting evidence.\nNo: “Figure 1 shows that poverty in center city neighborhoods in Cleveland is increasing.”\nYes: “Poverty in center city Cleveland is increasing (see Table 1).”"

    "section": "Usage",
    "text": "Usage\n\nPrint and Proof\nWe increasingly have an imperative to produce, edit, and disseminate our work using a completely electronic workflow. This has its benefits, but you need to develop a workflow that allows you to edit your draft with diligence. Printing and proofing a document by hand can often catch errors that would otherwise become lost in digital copy - such mistakes often reveal themselves in embarrassingly stark relief once disseminated.\n\n\nDefine Acronyms on First Use\nThe first time you use an acronym (e.g., HUD), spell it out, followed by the acronym in parentheses. “Data are from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).” Then use the acronym to your heart’s content.\n\n\nWrite out Numbers Less than 11\nAlthough sometimes the convention is that numbers one through ninety-nine should be spelled out. Numerals should be used for rates, percentages and other “data” indicators. Thus we would write “there are eight counties in the MSA,” but “the region grew by 8 percent.”\n\n\nSpell out Numbers Starting Sentences\nAny number that begins a sentence (or a bullet point) should be spelled out.\n\n\nWatch Your Capitalization\nNo need to capitalize industries, occupations, or other sectoral-type categories. Do not over-capitalize. Note that when referring to a single county, write “Tehama County.” But writing about multiple counties, it is “Tehama and Shasta counties.” Also: the “City of New York” but the “cities of Palo Alto and San Jose.”\n\n\nNo Apostrophe on Dates\nWhen referring to decades (e.g., 1990s), do not use an apostrophe.\n\n\nData are Plural\nNo: “The data is hard to find.”\nYes: “The data are hard to find.”\n\n\nUse Proper Note Punctuation\nNote numbers are best placed at the end of a sentence outside the punctuation.\nYes: This is a sentence that requires a citation.1\nNo: This is a sentence that requires a citation2.\n\n\nComplete Sentences in Notes\nFootnotes and endnotes should be complete sentences. Complete sentences have punctuation at the end.\n\n\nPunctuation Inside Quotes\nPunctuation generally goes inside quotes.\nYes: “Run, Tom, run,” said Jane.\nNo: “Down, Spot, down”, said Percival, Dick’s little-known cousin from Topeka.\n\n\nWrite out Percent\nOne of the few times the “less ink is better” rule is violated. Write “8 percent,” not “8%.” It’s less distracting to the eye.\n\n\nUse Arabic Numbers for Notes\nMicrosoft Word often defaults to the use of Roman numerals for notes and endnotes (i, ii, iii. . .). Change this option and use Arabic numerals. More efficient.\n\n\nCiting the URL is Not Enough\nIn the Internet age it has become distressingly common practice to cite only the URL for online documents. But consider this: if you quoted Tolstoy’s War and Peace using a copy you checked out from the New York Public Library, you would not cite the library as the source. The same principle applies to the Internet. For web sites, which are inherently Internet-based, you should list the name of the cite and then the URL. For documents accessed online, you should cite in the usual way (author, date, title, etc.) and then include the URL. Note that you are not obligated to list the URL for freestanding documents if you include the complete citation otherwise.\n\n\nAvoid Ampersand (&) in Text\nThe symbol “&”, known as the ampersand, should not be used in your text write-up. It is ok to use it for labels in tables and figures."

    "section": "Numbers",
    "text": "Numbers\n\nInterpret Quantities by Comparison\nDo not just report growth rates, quantities and other indicators for individual places. They are hard to interpret by themselves. For example, to back up a claim that your region has faced substantial population growth in the last decade, contrast its growth rate with the national average growth rate.\n\n\nExplain Regional Geography\nThe first time you mention your region, explain–either in the text or in a note–what its geographic composition is (e.g., its counties).\n\n\nSignificant Digits\nUse numbers with levels of precision that match the realistic precision in the underlying data. Should a location quotient be expressed as 1.709? No. Round to the nearest tenth (1.7). Percentage growth rates for subnational areas are also usually best expressed with one decimal place. Shares can be converted to percentages and expressed to one decimal place to make them more readable.\n\n\nOnly Include Exhibits You Reference in Text\nNo table, figure, chart or line drawing should be included in the report or report appendix unless it is referenced somewhere in the text discussion. That reference may be very brief (“see Table 4”), but it has to be there (it could also be in an endnote or footnote). Think of it this way: if it wasn’t important enough for you to mention it, why did you include it?\n\n\nReport the Quantity\nSometimes it is easy to forget to report the variable levels when we are analyzing variable trends. For example, it is common in analyses of wage trends (“wages are on the up and up”) to find nary a mention of wage levels. As a reader, you are left wondering “wages are going up, but are they high or low?” It is better to ground an analysis of changes in a given variable with a mention of the levels of the variable. So “The current annual average wage in River City for production workers is $27,500. That is up 12 percent in real terms since 1997. By contrast, the average production worker wage nationwide increased by 16.5 percent. . .”\n\n\nEmphasize Significant Findings\nWhen analyzing data we are looking for the most significant findings and often a “story” that helps explain those findings. In descriptive analysis, significance is often first assessed not in a statistical sense, but by looking for high and low values or major changes. But not all high/low values or large changes are necessarily important from a policy or planning point of view. Be careful to think through the potential implications of a finding before discussing it. Ask yourself: “So what?” If you can’t think of an answer, leave it out. (Example: “Since 1990, River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in every quarter except IIQ 1996 and IVQ 1998” might be better stated as “River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in 54 of the last 56 quarters.” A subtle change but the reader is not left asking: “Hmm, I wonder if I’m supposed to know why it was higher in those two periods?”\n\n\nPercent versus Percentage Points\nLet’s say you’re comparing the U.S. unemployment rate of 5.0 percent to the Peoria unemployment rate of 4.0 percent. Is the Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national rate? No. It is 1 percentage point lower. A Peoria rate 1 percent lower than the national average would be 4.95 percent.\n\n\nRefer to Exhibits in Text\nRefer to your figures and tables directly in your text. Example: “Table 2 reports employment growth figures for the 1995 to 2003 period.” Or: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (see Table 4).” If you are going to send readers to a table in a parenthetical phrase (like the last example), be sure to include the word “see.” So, you would not write: “Employment growth was particularly strong in the retail and construction sectors (Table 4).”"

    "title": "Communicating Quantitative Information",
    "section": "Tables, Figures and Graphics",
    "text": "Tables, Figures and Graphics\n\nMake ’Em so they Stand Alone\nFigures, graphs and tables should be constructed so that they can stand alone (as much as feasible). That is, someone could pick up and read the table without the accompanying text and get the gist of what it is trying to say. It goes without saying that sources of all data and calculations should be clearly indicated.\n\n\nAvoid Use of Grids in Tables\nThere is almost never any reason to include gridlines on a data table. Putting a line below the column headings and one below the last row of data, followed by the data source, is usually the best approach.\n\n\nDecimal Justify Data Columns\nLine up columns of numbers in tables on their explicit or implicit decimal points. Do not center justify numeric data.\n\n\nUse Descriptive Column Labels in Tables\nRemember the golden rule in table and figure construction: make it stand alone. That means column headings that someone can understand without reading the report body. Sometimes this is hard to do efficiently (headings can get too long). In such cases an alternative is to use short-hand headings but explain what they mean in a footnote to the table.\n\n\nUse Label Hierarchies in Tables\nA good way to make tables more efficient is to use hierarchical labeling of columns. In the table below, employment and payroll data for Illinois were available in 2003. But national and regional data were available only for 2001. The table efficiently reports the 2003 Illinois numbers along with national and Midwest growth rates for 1990-2001 and location quotients for 2001. A note at the bottom of the table should clarify how the Midwest is defined as well as what the reference area is for the location quotient.\n\n\n\nIndicate Source on Figures and Tables\nData sources should be indicated clearly on all figures and tables.\n\n\nUse Detailed Sources\nFor some series simply listing the data provider agency is not enough. For example, BLS reports several employment series. Therefore, list the series within BLS (or other) that you are using. For example, Regional Economic Information System, US Bureau of Economic Analysis, or Covered Wages and Employment, US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\nPie Chart? No Thanks\nWhile seductive to the eye, pie charts are far less interpretable than a simple bar chart. Go for conveying your findings clearly, not spicing up your document with spurious graphical devices.\n\n\nShun 3-D\nThree dimensional bar charts and other graphics generally should be avoided. They usually compromise proper interpretation of the findings. Keep it simple: no 3-D.\n\n\nCall Tables “Tables” and Figures “Figures”\nBy convention, tables are called “tables” and graphics such as data charts or line drawings are called “figures.” Sometimes people use the word “exhibit” to label a line drawing. Avoid use of the terms “chart” and “graphic” for labels (e.g., Chart 1, Graphic 1). Also, never call a table a figure or a figure a table. Note that exhibit labels are generally capitalized: “Population trends for River City are summarized in Table 4.”\n\n\nSequence Tables and Figures in Order in the Text\nIf you have three tables, do not discuss Table 1, then Table 3, then Table 2. If the results in Table 3 are mentioned prior to those in Table 2, renumber the tables. Same for figures or any other exhibit.\n\n\nUse Commas for Numbers\nIn data tables, include commas in the number formatting to denote significant digits. So: $47,500 instead of $47500.\n\n\nAvoid Grids on Figures\nMany graphical packages default settings include gridlines on charts. Most charts are simple enough not to need them to be clearly interpreted. Get rid of the clutter and save some ink!\n\n\nDon’t Rely on Color\nRemember that your best intents for people to view your document in color may be foiled - some individuals may print documents in grayscale, and others may be colorblind and unable to perceive all colors. That means your document should not depend on color to convey its findings. An example of depending on color would be to use red text in your tables to indicate negative values or any color to highlight interesting trends.\n\n\nReport Numbers in 000s\nIt is ok to report very large numbers in thousands or even millions in tables if the precision in the original units is unnecessary. It is probably not critical in most cases for people to know that the US population changed by 1,456,789 over a given period (1.46 million will probably suffice). For small areas, such as counties and regions, reporting the original units is usually preferred except for large number variables (e.g., total dollar income).\n\n\nNo Superfluous Material\nAvoid the practice of tacking on government documents or tables to your reports as “general points of information.” The idea in most professional writing is to convey maximum information with minimum material; tossing in nonessential material from secondary sources defeats that aim."

This neighborhood is designated as an American Planning Association Great Place in America. We will meet at Carle Park in Urbana at the intersection of Carle and Indiana streets.

    "section": "Assessment",
    "text": "Assessment\nMost of the methods classes you have probably taken have focused on grading you on your skill at reproducing specific outcomes. Our pedagogy in this class is that while it is possible to measure these outcomes, what is more important to assess is the process of learning as well as the effort you put into that process. Here’s some more detail on our thinking:\n\nA unitary assessment of performance in a 500-level class is not likely to serve students well. Each of you has proven time and time again in other classes that you can reproduce certain expected outcomes. The challenge in this class will focus on assessing your effort and learning process as opposed to the reproduction of outcomes. \nImplementing a contract-based assessment approach mirrors course goals regarding our understanding and practice around the power of data, particularly with regards to public deliberation, decision-making, and governance. Dealing differently with power around evaluation in our classroom mirrors how we might deal differently with power and power relationships in professional practice.\nThere is increasing evidence in higher education settings that unitary grading measures tend to hamper individual learning, and have the potential to be biased towards certain types of students. Put simply, obsessing about grades in advanced coursework is counter-productive to deep learning. This course adheres to the pedagogy that when given more control and ownership over the terms of evaluation, a student is more likely to embrace the challenges presented to them within the classroom, and are more likely to take ownership of their work (see, for instance Elbow and Inoue).\n\n\nContract Expectation Summary\nEach of you begins the semester with an “A” in the class. You may alter your grade based upon the choices you make regarding the following accountability expectations: \n\n\n\nGrade\nAbsences\nLate\nMissed\nIgnored\n\n\n\n\nA\n3\n1\n0\n0\n\n\nB\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n\nC\n4\n2\n1\n1\n\n\nD\n5\n3\n2\n1\n\n\nF\n6\n4\n3\n1\n\n\n\n\nAbsences indicate the number of times you are absent from class. Additional excused absences may be allowed due to documented extenuating circumstances.\nLate Assignments are assignments submitted after a due date but within 48 hours of the due date.\nMissed Assignments are assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date.\nIgnored Assignments are assignments that are not submitted by the last day of class (excluding your final assignment). Ignored assignments are a more serious breach of contract than missed assignments as they reflect contracted work which you have not completed.\n\nPlease note that assessment of these contracted standards are based upon what you do. The contracted grade does assess of the quality of your work. You will reflect upon and will receive direct feedback on the quality of your work as part of the assignment review process. Note that we reserve the right to adjust grades based upon exceptionally strong or weak engagement within the class. We will provide sufficient feedback over the course of the semester so that your final grade in the class should not be a surprise based upon what you do and how you reflect upon your learning over the course of the semester."
