<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="basic-communication-strategies">Basic Communication Strategies</h2>
<section id="memo-format" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memo-format">Memo Format</h3>
<p>Memos are often used by urban planners to share information within their agency or with other planners and local government officials. Memos tend to be concise documents that may contain either requested information for staff or recommendations on how to debate or take action around a particular policy issue. Memos are built around clear and concise writing with a logical structure, clear illustrations and visualizations, proper formatting and spelling.</p>
<p>Memos start with a heading that includes the name of the memo author, name of the intended recipient, date, and a descriptive subject heading:</p>
<p><strong>Memorandum</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>To:</strong> Janet Jacobs, Planning Director<br>
<strong>From:</strong> Mae Q. Plannington, Planner 1<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> October 7, 2022<br>
<strong>Subject:</strong> Recommendation on Zoning Change for Holloway Parcel</p>
<p>A memo is typically written in response to something. The first paragraph of the memo should describe what the memo is responding to, and should summarize what the writer of the memo has done to prepare the response. The first paragraph should also summarize any key findings or recommendations.</p>
<p>Information within a memo should be organized in a logical fashion. Section headings with descriptive titles help your audience find particular information more easily.</p>
<p>General information should be presented first followed by more detailed information. As you support information with evidence, you should follow the same progression of general to specific.</p>
<p>Memos should conclude with a summary statement that encapsulates the key findings which you have come up with. If you are providing recommendations in your memo, this is also an appropriate place to re-state your recommendations, and provide instructions for how your memo recipient should follow up.</p>
<p>Because a memo is designed to be a concise document, you may have important additional information which would be useful to share, but which does not fit within the scope of the memorandum. Such items can be included in an appendix or attachment to the memo, and should be referenced as appropriate within the memo (e.g.&nbsp;“See the attached document for the property surveyor’s description of the Holloway parcel”).</p>
</section>
<section id="short-report-format" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="short-report-format">Short Report Format</h3>
<p>Present your analysis in the format of a short report or “data brief.”</p>
</section>
<section id="do-not-include-title-page" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="do-not-include-title-page">Do Not Include Title Page</h3>
<p>Title pages have their place in academic papers and larger, formal technical reports. However, they are inappropriate for memos and short data or policy briefs. Keep it simple.</p>
</section>
<section id="avoid-headers-and-footers-in-memos" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-headers-and-footers-in-memos">Avoid Headers and Footers in Memos</h3>
<p>Running footers and headers also have their place for certain types of documents, but not for memos.</p>
</section>
<section id="no-conclusion-needed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="no-conclusion-needed">No Conclusion Needed</h3>
<p>In other contexts, you have likely been taught to include both introductions and conclusions as ways to help transition in and out of different sections. The memo format is more direct, and does not require the use of opening and closing paragraphs. State you case and let it go at that.</p>
</section>
<section id="notes-and-citations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes-and-citations">Notes and Citations</h3>
<section id="use-notes-for-technical-explanations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-notes-for-technical-explanations">Use Notes for Technical Explanations</h4>
<p>Footnotes or endnotes are best for stating brief technical explanations for methods and data. Reports may require a longer methodological appendix, but this is typically not appropriate for a memorandum.</p>
</section>
<section id="use-notes-for-citations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="use-notes-for-citations">Use Notes for Citations</h4>
<p>Use an endnote or footnote to cite sources for memos and report briefs. Bibliographies or “Works Cited” lists are appropriate for longer reports or academic papers.</p>
</section>
<section id="combine-data-source-citations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="combine-data-source-citations">Combine Data Source Citations</h4>
<p>It makes good sense to use endnotes or footnotes to discuss data used in an analysis in a memo or report brief. But you do not necessarily need to use a separate note for each data source or series. Instead, combine them by introducing one note early in the document. Something like: “The data used in this analysis are from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 5-year American Community Survey and 2020 Census Household Pulse Survey”.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="formatting-considerations-for-printing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="formatting-considerations-for-printing">Formatting Considerations for Printing</h3>
<p>Increasingly, memos and other routine planning communications are communicated digitally, however, it is important to prepare documents that will be legible when printed. In most circumstances, formatting considerations for printing will also apply to documents intended to be communicated digitally.</p>
<section id="left-justify-text" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="left-justify-text">Left Justify Text</h4>
<p>Use left justification for text, and not full justification.</p>
</section>
<section id="include-page-numbers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="include-page-numbers">Include Page Numbers</h4>
<p>Include page numbers in the bottom center or bottom right of your page.</p>
</section>
<section id="one-inch-margins" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-inch-margins">One Inch Margins</h4>
<p>Use one inch margins on the left, right, top and bottom, including on all pages with tables and figures.</p>
</section>
<section id="twelve-point-font" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="twelve-point-font">Twelve point font</h4>
<p>Use a twelve point font, preferably something like Times for your text. You can use a ten point font for footnotes and endnotes. No text should be smaller than ten points.</p>
</section>
</section>
</section>
<section id="style" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="style">Style</h2>
<section id="awkward-sentence-construction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="awkward-sentence-construction">Awkward Sentence Construction</h3>
<p>A catch-all category for a painful-to-read but not necessarily grammatically incorrect sentence. Sentence may be an affront to good writing style. Admittedly, professors often put AWK in places where they know something is amiss, but not being writing instructors, they’re not sure technically how to explain what is wrong. Bottom line: the sentence doesn’t work. Proofread yourself and then have someone else read to ensure clarity.</p>
</section>
<section id="write-directly" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="write-directly">Write Directly</h3>
<p>Don’t mince words: come out and say it. Instead of “The BLS and BEA data show that employment in the microchip industry is very small,” write “Employment in the microchip industry is very small.” Or, instead of “It is very important to note that data disclosure rules preclude reporting employment for all sectors,” write “Data disclosure rules preclude. . .”</p>
</section>
<section id="avoid-excessive-use-of-jargon" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-excessive-use-of-jargon">Avoid Excessive Use of Jargon</h3>
<p>Avoid the planner’s pitfall: too much use of all those fancy planning terms and acronyms. It’s not impressive or erudite, just boring.</p>
</section>
<section id="avoid-passive-voice" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-passive-voice">Avoid Passive Voice</h3>
<p>The extensive use of passive voice may be the single most common reason why a majority of sane individuals would rather walk on hot coals than read a technical document. Doesn’t “The region’s population growth dramatically outpaced the nation’s over the study period” sound better than “Using population data, it was found that the region grew much faster than the US over the study period”?</p>
<p>Another example: replace “A three-part analysis will be conducted in this paper” with “This paper will present a three-part analysis” or “In this paper, I will conduct a three-part analysis.” Reject passivity. Be active.</p>

<p>Use headings and subheadings to help organize your findings and discussion. In addition, keep ’em active and efficient. Instead of “Location Quotient Analysis” as a sub-heading, try a short title that conveys findings, e.g., “Region Specialized in Manufacturing and Services.” Headings and subheadings should never extend beyond one line of text.</p>

<section id="avoid-unnecessary-equivocation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="avoid-unnecessary-equivocation">Avoid Unnecessary Equivocation</h3>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense to offer caveats or otherwise “hedge your bets” when discussing a finding. However, don’t overdo it. Population growth doesn’t “seem fast.” It either is or is not fast, relative to something else (which you should be comparing it to). A location quotient indicates whether a region is or is not specialized in a given industry; it does not indicate that the region “seems specialized” or “may be specialized.” On the other hand, location quotients do not say much beyond specialization (you would not damn the torpedoes and argue, on the basis of a manufacturing LQ above 1.2, that the region is “highly competitive” in manufacturing).</p>
<p>If you find yourself making equivocations, it’s worthwhile to revisit the evidence you’ve provided to make a point to ensure you’re making the strongest argument possible. Communicate that argument confidently, and provide appropriate caveats when necessary.</p>

<p>In academic papers or longer reports it often makes sense to provide a roadmap to the document (e.g., “This report begins by summarizing major trends in population. It then. . .”).

<p>In discussing social, economic, and demographic trends for neighborhoods, cities and regions, avoid implying that places have “agency.” Example:</p>
<p>El Paso shifted its population mix in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.</p>
<p>In this case, El Paso as a collective, is being treated as an actor when it is actually simply a place with a collection of actors (people, households, businesses, organizations) who are reacting to the federal policy change in various ways.</p>
<p>It would be more accurate to say something like this:</p>
<p>El Paso’s population mix shifted in response to major changes in Federal immigration policy.</p>
<p>There may be cases when implying the place is an actor makes sense, for instance when you are discussing a community-wide strategy or policy.</p>

The same principle applies to the Internet. For web sites, which are inherently Internet-based, you should list the name of the cite and then the URL.

<p>No table, figure, chart or line drawing should be included in the report or report appendix unless it is referenced somewhere in the text discussion.

<section id="report-the-quantity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="report-the-quantity">Report the Quantity</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is easy to forget to report the variable levels when we are analyzing variable trends. For example, it is common in analyses of wage trends (“wages are on the up and up”) to find nary a mention of wage levels. As a reader, you are left wondering “wages are going up, but are they high or low?” It is better to ground an analysis of changes in a given variable with a mention of the levels of the variable. So “The current annual average wage in River City for production workers is $27,500. That is up 12 percent in real terms since 1997. By contrast, the average production worker wage nationwide increased by 16.5 percent. . .”</p>

<section id="emphasize-significant-findings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="emphasize-significant-findings">Emphasize Significant Findings</h3>
<p>When analyzing data we are looking for the most significant findings and often a “story” that helps explain those findings. In descriptive analysis, significance is often first assessed not in a statistical sense, but by looking for high and low values or major changes. But not all high/low values or large changes are necessarily important from a policy or planning point of view. Be careful to think through the potential implications of a finding before discussing it. Ask yourself: “So what?” If you can’t think of an answer, leave it out. (Example: “Since 1990, River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in every quarter except IIQ 1996 and IVQ 1998” might be better stated as “River City’s unemployment rate has registered below the U.S. rate in 54 of the last 56 quarters.” A subtle change but the reader is not left asking: “Hmm, I wonder if I’m supposed to know why it was higher in those two periods?”</p>

<p>Figures, graphs and tables should be constructed so that they can stand alone (as much as feasible).

But national and regional data were available only for 2001. The table efficiently reports the 2003 Illinois numbers along with national and Midwest growth rates for 1990-2001 and location quotients for 2001.
