## Session Description

We'll continue to check-in and workshop your final projects. For this session, we'll be examining your *best evidence* - the facts or analysis that you believe best makes the point you're trying to convey to your audience.

Come to class prepared to share your best evidence with the entire class. You will each be asked to take a few minutes to present your best evidence and recieve feedback on it.

## Before Class

Prepare your best evidence for sharing. This might be preparing or exporting a bit of analysis or coming the class prepared to articulate and share this evidence.

## Reflect

1. How does this evidence support the point you're trying to make?

2. How do you plan to use the evidence in your argument?

3. What critiques might others have regarding your evidence? How are you planning to preemptively engage these critiques in your analysis?
