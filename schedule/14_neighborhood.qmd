## Session Description

In this session, we'll begin exploring the measurement of neighborhood change as well as underlying theories of transition.

## Before Class

WBEZ: [There Goes the Neighborhood](https://interactive.wbez.org/gentrification/)

[Who Can Live in Chicago?: A Tale of Three Cities](https://voorheescenter.uic.edu/who-can-live-in-chicago/)

[The Socioeconomic Change of Chicago's Community Areas (1970-2010)](https://voorheescenter.red.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/122/2017/10/Voorhees-Center-Gentrification-Index-Oct-14.pdf)

## Reflect

-   What role should planners take in managing neighborhood change?
-   How do planners balance changes across multiple neighborhoods?
-   How can value judgements placed on change influence the types of solutions we propose (and their feasibility)?
