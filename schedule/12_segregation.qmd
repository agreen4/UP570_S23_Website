## Reflect

- Why, in your opinion, does segregation remain an enduring characteristic for most American cities, despite efforts to address it?
- How can visualization of segregation (and its consequences) make a difference?
- What can segregation measures capture well? What aspects of segregation are more challenging to measure?
