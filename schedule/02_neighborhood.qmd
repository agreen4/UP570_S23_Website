## Session Description

In this session, we'll explore the many ways in which the concept of neighborhoods are used in various areas of urban planning and governance. We will continue to build upon our initial discussion regarding the significance of neighborhoods as a unit of analysis, planning, and policymaking, and will explore frameworks for neighborhood analysis.

## Before Class

Your readings for today provide insight into some of the working definitions for value judgments regarding the qualities of neighborhoods and why planners have found these qualities to be of importance to measure and understand.

## Reflect

-   What are your goals for taking this class? What would you like to learn about neighborhoods?
-   What matters about neighborhoods? How have neighborhoods shaped your life?
-   What types of stories do we tend to tell about neighborhoods? How do these stories contextualize how neighborhoods "fit" within cities and their regions?
