## Session Description

So far, we have started to learn how to tell stories about places using existing indicators. With so many available sources of existing information, it can be easy to experience a disconnect between the values of those indicators and the complexity of what they represent. To think more about what grounds our analysis as planners, this week we will go explore a neighborhood in person and then think through elements of the stories that may help us describe that place through indicators.

We will meet at TBH on Monday to start thinking about our plans for storytelling and description about the West Urbana neighborhood. On Wednesday, we will meet in the neighborhood to focus on field observation.

## Before Class

-   Write a short reflection on your pre-existing impressions of the West Urbana neighborhood. Some of you may be very familiar, and others may not at all. Reflect based upon what you know or have heard.

## During Class

Work collaboratively with your group members to develop a short memorandum describing the West Urbana neighborhood. Your memo should include demographic information coming from census data or other sources of secondary data (please start with the same selected census indicators we have worked with for the past few weeks).

Your memo should outline the following:

1.  Neighborhood character, identity, and assets - drawing from secondary data, describe the character, identity, and assets of the neighborhood:
    1.  Infrastructure and Environment
    2.  Economy and Housing
    3.  Health and Wellbeing
    4.  Sense of Place
2.  Information Gaps - based upon your group's description above, what information gaps exist? What types of information do you need to prioritize observation of on the ground in the West Urbana neighborhood?
3.  Proposed Strategy for Systematic Examination - based upon your assessment of information gaps, how do you propose collecting that information, and how would you integrate it into your report?

We will use this background information as a starting place which you will build upon in your groups through field observation on Wednesday.
